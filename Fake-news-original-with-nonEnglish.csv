California is backsliding on water conservation.

Primary school allows pupils to wear slippers to improve grades,"A school in Derbyshire is encouraging its pupils to wear slippers in the classroom to help improve their grades.Findern Primary School, near Derby, is the latest to adopt the Scandinavian attitude of allowing children to take their shoes off inside.Headteacher Emma Titchener suggested the idea to pupils after reading the results of a study that claimed ‰ÛÏshoeless‰Û children typically showed better behaviour and greater performance in class.Observing thousands of children from 25 countries of a ten-year period, researchers from the University of Bournemouth found those who left their shoes outside the classroom were more likely to arrive at school earlier, leave later and read more widely.Trialling the method in one class, teachers at Findern said they saw a significant difference in how students felt and acted in the classroom.Ms Tichener told the Telegraph: ‰ÛÏIt has had a real positive impact; the children are much calmer and more receptive to learning.‰ÛÏThe pupils for more comfortable, they feel more at home and more in tune with the classes.‰ÛÏThe reception among children and teachers has been unanimously positive, and parents are also overwhelmingly supportive of it.The world's toughest school run 5 show all The world's toughest school run 1/5 Children carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 2/5 Children carry their schoolbags accompanied by adults climb on a cliff bu using ladder as they on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 3/5 A child carry her schoolbag looks as she takes a rest on a cliff as she and other children on their way back to home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 4/5 A village in China's mountainous west where schoolchildren must climb an 800-meter (2,625-foot)-high bamboo ladder secured to a sheer cliff face may get a set of steel stairs to improve safety Chinatopix/AP 5/5 Schoolchildren carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 1/5 Children carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 2/5 Children carry their schoolbags accompanied by adults climb on a cliff bu using ladder as they on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 3/5 A child carry her schoolbag looks as she takes a rest on a cliff as she and other children on their way back to home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 4/5 A village in China's mountainous west where schoolchildren must climb an 800-meter (2,625-foot)-high bamboo ladder secured to a sheer cliff face may get a set of steel stairs to improve safety Chinatopix/AP 5/5 Schoolchildren carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/APThe school‰Ûªs Deputy Headteacher, Michelle Hall, said the policy had since been extended across the school and most children and even some members of staff were now choosing to wear slippers over shoes.‰ÛÏOur pupils are already very well behaved but there have been some changes,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏThere is less stomping around and the pupils are a lot calmer and seem very relaxed.‰ÛThe school is believed to be one of the first in the country to introduce the relaxed rules on shoewear, but the approach has long been used by schools in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries where the practice is commonplace.In order to conduct their study, researchers from the University of Bournemouth visited schools in New Zealand and Australia, as well as a school in London where the habit had been tested.Experts found that by removing shoes, classrooms were quieter, providing a calmer atmosphere where pupils were more willing to engage in learning activities.Bullying in schools where the policy had been introduced was also markedly reduced.In Scandinavia and other northern European countries, children are asked to leave shoes outside the classroom during bad weather, so as not to bring in slush and snow from outside.However schools in Spain, where it is more common to wear shoes indoors, also tested out the theory and found improved learning and pupil behaviour.Responding to some criticism of the policy from parents of Findern school pupils, Ms Titchener said: ‰ÛÏLike anything you will always get some opposition to these things, but I think the idea that this makes the children less smartly dressed or less prepared for formal situations is a misconception.‰ÛBournemouth University said it hoped more UK schools would take up the change and see results.",Pupils at Findern Primary School are among the latest to reap benefits from following the Scandinavian practice of leaving shoes at the door,['Rachael Pells'],http://ow.ly,0,0,0.5,1,10,779,23,0,0,0.4,0.160939061,0.3,0
"‰Û÷UK acting as weapons pimp, reaping rewards of Saudi Arabia‰Ûªs dirty work‰Ûª","We know Riyadh has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there, and they have also attacked the indigenous of Yemen, the Houthis, Raza Kazim, Islamic Human Rights Commission, told RT.A cross-party group of British MPs have to decide whether to call for the suspension of UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia or not. The British Prime Minister Theresa May insists sales should continue, and claims the close ties to the country are necessary to keep British people safe.Read moreHer comments came after some British MPs called for the UK to halt its weapons sales to the Middle Eastern nation. Members of the Arms Export Controls committee claim that British weapons might have been used in violations of international humanitarian law.RT: The Prime Minister's comments have now been backed by the Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. Yet reports suggest quite the opposite. Why are Britain's decision makers going against the clear findings?Raza Kazim: I think we need to look at the plethora of evidence that has been gathered. The Committee itself has said that the UK government is probably in violation of its international human rights obligations due to the way that the weapons that have been supplied by the UK have been used. It is said that the assurances supplied by the Saudi government are also not sufficient, not acceptable and so on. Yet, the UK government continues. We need to understand that basically the UK government is acting like a pimp, and is reaping the benefits of the dirty work that Saudi Arabia is actually doing. This needs to stop.RT: Saudi Arabia is claiming if the UK suspends arms sales, there might be even higher risks of terrorism spreading. Is that a valid point?RK: There is no evidence to suggest that. Saudi Arabia is the one that is carrying out acts of terrorism. We know that it has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there. We‰Ûªve seen how Saudi Arabia has attacked Yemen and the indigenous of Yemen, as well, the Houthis, who have been wanting to have self-determination in terms of who is governing them, rather than something that is imposed from Riyadh. We‰Ûªve seen that various organizations, Save the Children, have come out and said that they are not happy with what has been going on. Hospitals, schools and school teachers, head teachers, etc. have been bombed by Saudi Arabia. We‰Ûªve seen the facilities of MÌ©decins Sans FrontiÌ¬res [(MSF) Doctors Without Borders] hospitals being bombed and verified by MSF.Yet, despite all the evidence that has been gathered in terms of what has been going on, the UK government continues this. We need to be aware that the intelligence offices and people from the UK military establishment are embedded in the command and control center of where these strikes take place. This has been verified in various ways ‰ÛÒ by both Saudi Arabia and the UK. We know that this is going on continuously...Not easy to resist temptation of easy moneyDaoud Khairallah, International Law professor at Georgetown University said that it has not been easy for Britain, the US, or other countries that are providing Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons, ‰ÛÏto resist the temptation of money and corruption.‰ÛRT: The Prime Minister's comments have now been backed by the Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. Yet reports suggest quite the opposite. Why are Britain's decision makers going against the clear findings?Daoud Khairallah: Well, it has not been easy whether for Britain, or the US, or other countries that are providing Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons. It has not been easy to resist the temptation of money and corruption in this sense. The fact is that we have a threat to the international community, to the whole world by terrorism, and the source of support of these terrorist organizations is well-known now. We know the role that Saudi Arabia is playing.Read moreAdd to this, when Saudi Arabia is involved in military operations, such as in Yemen, crimes of war and crimes against humanities have been committed. And the international community has not been sufficiently diligent to investigate and make accountable those responsible for it. Very few journalist and otherwise have the moral courage of speaking out. In the UK apparently some free minds are expressing concerns and rightly so. This is in response to what the whole human race now is concerned about.RT: Theresa May rejected calls for the UK to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia and stressed the value of close security co-operation with Riyadh. So do you believe the grounds for such a decision are good enough?DK: The only explanation is the temptation of providing Saudi Arabia with weapons that are richly paid for by the Saudis. It is very difficult to find another explanation, another reasonable explanation. Humanity is not safer with more violence; it is not safer with encouraging extremist groups that are doing all over the Middle East now and expending throughout the world ‰ÛÒ things that are of real concern to the human race and those who still have some moral courage to speak about it.","We know Riyadh has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there, and they have also attacked the indigenous of Yemen, the Houthis, Raza Kazim, Islamic Human Rights Commission, told RT.",[],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,0,12,872,36,1,0,-0.3,0.067535014,0.066666667,0

"Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in Prison","Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in PrisonPhoto Credit: By Miller Center [CC-BY-2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia CommonsEver since Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented move to legalize recreational pot last year, excitement and stories of unfettered success have billowed into the air. Colorado's marijuana tax revenue far exceeded expectations, bringing a whopping $185 million to the state, and tourists are lining up to taste the budding culture (pun intended). Several other states are now looking to follow suit and legalize.But the ramifications of this momentous shift are left unaddressed. When you flick on the TV to a segment about the flowering pot market in Colorado, you'll find that the faces of the movement are primarily white and male. Meanwhile, many of the more than 210,000 people who were arrested for marijuana possession in Colorado between 1986 and 2010 according to a report from the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, remain behind bars. Thousands of black men and boys still sit in prisons for possession of the very plant that's making those white guys on TV rich.‰ÛÏIn many ways the imagery doesn't sit right,‰Û said Michelle Alexander, associate professor of law at Ohio State University and author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in a public conversation on March 6 with Asha Bandele of the Drug Policy Alliance. ‰ÛÏHere are white men poised to run big marijuana businesses, dreaming of cashing in big‰ÛÓbig money, big businesses selling weed‰ÛÓafter 40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed. Now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?‰ÛAlexander said she is ‰ÛÏthrilled‰Û that Colorado and Washington have legalized pot and that Washington D.C. decriminalized possession of small amounts earlier this month. But she said she‰Ûªs noticed ""warning signs"" of a troubling trend emerging in the pot legalization movement: Whites‰ÛÓmen in particular‰ÛÓare the face of the movement, and the emerging pot industry. (A recent In These Times article titled ‰ÛÏThe Unbearable Whiteness of Marijuana Legalization,‰Û summarize this trend.)Alexander said for 40 years poor communities of color have experienced the wrath of the war on drugs.‰ÛÏBlack men and boys‰Û have been the target of the war on drugs‰Ûª racist policies‰ÛÓstopped, frisked and disturbed‰ÛÓ‰ÛÏoften before they‰Ûªre old enough to vote,‰Û she said. Those youths are arrested most often for nonviolent first offenses that would go ignored in middle-class white neighborhoods.‰ÛÏWe arrest these kids at young ages, saddle them with criminal records, throw them in cages, and then release them into a parallel social universe in which the very civil and human rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights movement no longer apply to them for the rest of their lives,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏThey can be discriminated against [when it comes to] employment, housing, access to education, public benefits. They're locked into a permanent second-class status for life. And we‰Ûªve done this in precisely the communities that were most in need of our support.‰ÛAs Asha Bandele of DPA pointed out during the conversation, the U.S. has 5% of the world‰Ûªs population and 25% of the world‰Ûªs prisoners. Today, 2.2 million people are in prison or jail and 7.7 million are under the control of the criminal justice system, with African American boys and men‰ÛÓand now women‰ÛÓmaking up a disproportionate number of those imprisoned.Alexander‰Ûªs book was published four years ago and spent 75 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, helping to bring mass incarceration to the forefront of the national discussion.Alexander said over the last four years, as she‰Ûªs been traveling from state to state speaking to audiences from prisons to universities about her book, she‰Ûªs witnessed an ‰ÛÏawakening.‰Û More and more people are talking about mass incarceration, racism and the war on drugs.Often when people talk about the reasons certain communities are impoverished or lack education they blame the personal choices or moral shortcomings of the people in those communities, but that way of looking at things has got it backwards, she said.‰ÛÏThat these communities are poor and have failing schools and have broken rules is not because of their personal failings but because we‰Ûªve declared war on them,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏWe‰Ûªve spent billions of dollars building prisons and allowing schools to fail. We‰Ûªve decimated these communities by shuttling young people from their underfunded schools to these brand new, high tech prisons. We‰Ûªve begun targeting children in these communities at young ages.‰ÛAlexander cautioned that drug policy activists need to keep this disparity in mind and cultivate a conversation about repairing the damages done by the systemic racism of the war on drugs, before cashing in on legalization.‰ÛÏAfter waging a brutal war on poor communities of color, a drug war that has decimated families, spread despair and hopelessness through entire communities, and a war that has fanned the flames of the very violence it was supposedly intended to address and control; after pouring billions of dollars into prisons and allowing schools to fail; we‰Ûªre gonna simply say, we‰Ûªre done now?‰Û Alexander said. ‰ÛÏI think we have to be willing, as we‰Ûªre talking about legalization, to also start talking about reparations for the war on drugs, how to repair the harm caused.‰ÛAlexander used the example of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa to point out the way a society can and should own up to its past mistakes. After apartheid ended, the nation passed a law called the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. Under the new law, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed to ""elicit truth"" about the human rights violations that had occurred. The commission recorded the statements of witnesses who endured ""gross human rights violations"" and facilitated public hearings. Those who had committed violence could request amnesty from civil and criminal prosecution in order to share testimony about what they'd done with the commission.‰ÛÏAt the end of apartheid in South Africa there was an understanding that there could be no healing, no progress, no reconciliation without truth,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏYou can‰Ûªt just destroy a people and then say ‰Û÷It‰Ûªs over, we‰Ûªre stopping now.‰Ûª You have to be willing to deal with the truth, deal with the history openly and honestly.‰ÛAlexander pointed to America‰Ûªs tendency to shove its racist legacies under the rug rather than own up to them. When the civil war ended, slaves were free on paper but they were left with nothing‰ÛÓ‰ÛÏno 40 acres and a mule, nothing,‰Û Alexander said. The only option was to work low-paying contract jobs for the same slave owners who had previously brutalized them.‰ÛÏAnd after a brief period of reconstruction a new caste system was imposed‰ÛÓJim Crow‰ÛÓand another extraordinary movement arose and brought the old Jim Crow to its knees,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏAmericans said, OK, we‰Ûªll stop now. We‰Ûªll take down the whites-only signs, we‰Ûªll stop doing that. But there were not reparations for slavery, not for Jim Crow, and scarcely an acknowledgement of the harm done except for Martin Luther King Day, one day out of the year.

Alexander said she‰Ûªs glad Obama is shining a spotlight on the crisis facing black communities. However, she said Obama has perpetuated the backward way of framing the situation when he talks about the issues facing those communities.""I am worried that much of the initiative is more based in rhetoric than in meaningful commitment to address the structures and institutions that have created the conditions in these communities,"" she said.Asked about the unlikely relationship forming between U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Kentucky‰Ûªs Tea Party senator Rand Paul, both of whom are standing together to end mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, Alexander responded she is wary of whether these politicians are making the right decisions for the wrong reasons.She cautioned that politicians across the political spectrum are ‰ÛÏhighly motivated‰Û to downsize prisons because the U.S. can no longer afford to maintain a massive prison state without raising taxes ‰ÛÏon the predominantly white middle class.‰Û That shortsighted way of thinking fails to recognize the larger societal patterns that keep the U.S. cycling through various ‰ÛÏcaste-like‰Û systems.‰ÛÏIf we're going to downsize these prisons and change marijuana laws and all that, in order to save some cash, but in that process to change these laws, we haven't woken up to the magnitude of the harm that we have done,‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏUltimately, at least from my perspective, this movement to end mass incarceration and this movement to end the drug war is about breaking our nation‰Ûªs habit of creating caste-like systems in America,‰Û she said. She added that regardless of whether they‰Ûªre struggling with addiction and drug abuse or have a felony on their record, people deserve to be treated with basic human rights.‰ÛÏHow were we able to permanently lock out of mainstream society tens of millions of people, destroy families?‰Û she said. ‰ÛÏIf we‰Ûªre not going to have a real conversation about that and ultimately be willing to care for ‰Û÷them,‰Ûª the ‰Û÷others,‰Ûª those ‰Û÷ghetto dwellers‰Ûª who‰Ûªve been demonized in this rush to declare war, we‰Ûªre going to find ourselves years from now either still having a slightly downsized system of mass incarceration that continues to hum along very well, or we will have managed to downsize our prisons but some new system of racial and social control will have emerged again because we have not yet learned the core lesson that our racial history has been trying to teach us.‰ÛListen to the complete talk here.","For 40 years, poor communities of color have experienced the wrath of the war on drugs.

Conservatives declare 'huge win' after IRS impeachment delay,"Conservative House lawmakers said Thursday that they achieved ""a huge win"" in a deal to postpone a floor vote to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., and leaders of the House Freedom Caucus worked out a last-minute deal Wednesday to postpone the impeachment vote, which Rep. John Fleming, R-La., had called up on Tuesday. Instead of the vote, the Judiciary panel will hold an impeachment hearing Wednesday where Koskinen will be questioned under oath.Fleming, a Freedom Caucus member, said Thursday the group would ""still reserve the right"" to bring up an impeachment vote, but said it would come after the November election at the earliest.""To me, this is a huge win for us because there is more information,"" Fleming said. ""We want to get him under oath and explain why he did what he did. Then we'll have even more information to move forward, if indeed the evidence comes out that he was corrupt and certainly not protective of the important information necessary for this case.""Republicans have been battling Koskinen for many months over the IRS chief's handling of emails and other data related to the agency's history of targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.Many GOP lawmakers believe Koskinen withheld information and did not adequately work to preserve critical emails and other data related to the targeting.""We want to get him under oath and explain to us why he did what he did and why he didn't take custody of the tapes,"" Fleming said, referring to the lost emails, ""why he allowed them to be destroyed, why he lied to Congress about all of this. We want to get him on record.""But others are nervous about the vote, and the party is known to be split on whether to impeach Koskinen or not. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Thursday he was not involved directly in the deal.""The members worked the differences out with themselves and the committee of jurisdiction,"" Ryan said. That's how I like getting things handled here. This agreement is a good way of getting things worked out.""Meanwhile, not all conservatives are satisfied with the deal. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., told reporters Thursday he believed the impeachment vote would move forward next week.His spokesman has so far not responded to a request for a comment on Huelskamp's claim, which Ryan denied.""My understanding is in lieu of the vote, they are going to have the hearing,"" Ryan said.The Tea Party Patriots issued a statement denouncing the deal and called for an impeachment vote before Congress leaves town ahead of the November election.""Are congressmen really willing to go home and say they sided with the IRS over the American taxpayer?"" spokeswoman Jenny Beth Martin said. ""That they sided with the IRS over their constituents?""","Conservative House lawmakers said Thursday that they achieved ""a huge win"" in a deal to postpone a floor vote to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.",['Graeme Jennings'],http://washex.am,0,0,0.5,1,8,472,25,1,0,0.6,0.219688645,0.6,0

Why you shouldn‰Ûªt work at full capacity,"Have you ever felt like you couldn‰Ûªt take time off work because nobody could do your job while you‰Ûªre away? Do you drop all of your personal plans to work late nights and weekends, and feel guilty simply leaving the office on time?Work martyrs are drastically changing company culture and leading to a rise in cases of stress and burnoutIf any of the above sounds familiar, then you may be one of the growing number of so-called ‰ÛÏwork martyrs‰Û who are drastically changing company culture and leading to a rise in cases of stress and burnout.Binal Patel is the first person to admit he‰Ûªs a work martyr and that he‰Ûªs been suffering from mild burnout by sacrificing all of his free time for his career.The 25-year old data scientist from Raleigh, North Carolina in the US, says his problems began two years ago when he dove headfirst into a new job at a start-up running analytics for the healthcare industry. There were just 12 employees at the time, and Patel remembers setting the bar a bit too high, working ‰ÛÏ12 hours a day at 200%.‰ÛThe recent university graduate soon realised that taking on masochistic amounts of work was unsustainableAt first, the positive recognition was addicting, but the recent university graduate soon realised that taking on masochistic amounts of work was unsustainable.‰ÛÏOver time, your company expects you to work at that initial level because that‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªve done before, and you expect yourself to be at that level because that‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªve been putting in,‰Û he says. ‰ÛÏBut working that hard all the time just isn‰Ûªt feasible.‰ÛPatel found himself becoming less productive and efficient the more hours he put in. He says it took an emotional toll, too, ‰ÛÏbecause you expect yourself to be at a higher level.‰ÛPatel is not alone in this predicament. According to a new study from The Workforce Institute at Kronos, 81% of salaried employees in the US report that they work outside of their standard work hours, with 29% doing it three or more days per week. A separate study from the US-based Project: Time Off campaign found that millennials, in particular, are much more likely to become work martyrs than their older peers at a rate of 43%, compared with an average of just 29% across all workers.Millennials are much more likely to become work martyrs than their older peers at a rate of 43%, compared with an average of just 29%Experts caution that more time in the office doesn‰Ûªt equate to a better worker, and that bosses need to set clear goals to prevent building potential team burnout into their plans. If not, the repercussions of a stressed-out workforce will become more pronounced as millennials move into management roles and expect the same level of presenteeism from their subordinates.‰ÛÏWhat‰Ûªs the future of our work-life balance if this is the mentality we‰Ûªre fostering,‰Û says Katie Denis, lead researcher at Project: Time Off. There needs to be a drastic change in attitude among millennials, ‰ÛÏor we‰Ûªll see much bigger problems on the horizon.‰ÛStudies from Marianna Virtanen of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health have linked overworking with numerous stress-related health problems, including depression, impaired sleep and heavy drinking. Meanwhile, a new study of American, Australian and European workers found that those putting in 55 hours or more per week had a 33% greater risk of stroke and 13% greater risk of coronary heart disease when compared with their peers working a standard 40-hour week.Fear and uncertaintyThe current work martyr trend among 18- to 35-year-olds relates to both healthy ego needs (like striving for a sense of accomplishment) and unhealthy levels of anxiety, says Denis. ‰ÛÏYou hear this popular narrative that millennials are entitled and spoiled but what we‰Ûªre finding is that they actually have a lot of fear.‰ÛDenis says many millennials entered the workforce at the height of the recession when jobs were scarce. Not only that, they‰Ûªre dealing with an office culture where technology is ubiquitous, yet its boundaries remain unclear with many feeling chained to their devices.The Project: Time Off report found zero correlation between time spent working and career progression‰ÛÏThere‰Ûªs very little guidance in the workplace about what‰Ûªs appropriate [with technology], so it gives us this feeling that we need to be reachable at all times,‰Û she says. ‰ÛÏThis fuels a kind of hyper-intense desire to prove yourself that‰Ûªs playing out really strongly with millennials.‰ÛThe Project: Time Off report found zero correlation between time spent working and career progression. Quite the contrary, ‰ÛÏpeople reach a maximum threshold,‰Û Denis explains. ‰ÛÏEven though they may be at the office longer ‰ÛÓ or are working longer hours ‰ÛÓ it doesn‰Ûªt mean they‰Ûªre producing any more than their peers.‰ÛA preventable patternTy Tucker, CEO of performance management platform REV, says it‰Ûªs simple to prevent this type of workplace behaviour from occurring in the first place. ‰ÛÏManagement needs to define personal employee goals and identify how people are to be judged around performance,‰Û he explains.Bosses are often the biggest offenders of work martyrdomA manager should know what could reasonably be accomplished in a 40-hour week in order to prevent burnout and make appropriate choices about budgeting, staffing and measurable objectives, he says. By working off the clock, particularly when starting out, many employees unwittingly make this task harder on their managers.Tucker believes bosses are often the biggest offenders of work martyrdom. Not only do they set the wrong tone for their employees, but they‰Ûªre ultimately slowing down the business when they make themselves so indispensable to the company that nothing can happen without them.‰ÛÏWhen you create these bastions of isolated knowledge you are ultimately going to be less effective as an organisation,‰Û he says.Martyrs vs heroesWhile work martyrs can fall into a toxic trap of long hours and low productivity, Tucker believes there is a healthy alternative: the work hero.A work hero is usually results driven, not time driven, and may not even be cognisant that he or she is viewed as a hero‰ÛÏA work hero is someone who can come in, do a great job and save the day when something goes wrong,‰Û Tucker explains. ‰ÛÏThis person is usually results driven, not time driven, and may not even be cognisant that he or she is viewed as a hero.‰ÛPatel, the data scientist from Raleigh, is now striving toward the latter. He starts a new job in 2017 and says he‰Ûªs going to do the exact opposite of what he did when he entered his current company.‰ÛÏWhen I start my new role it won‰Ûªt be about me jumping into everything,‰Û he says. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªll still do my job, of course, but I‰Ûªll make it much more of a team-based effort.‰ÛTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or tweet us on Twitter.","Working too hard is a recipe for burnout.

The Boston Business Journal ranked Kerry‰Ûªs house the third most valuable home in the city in 2013.The Department of State has funneled more than $9 million through the Peace Corps to Seed since 2012, TheDCNF previously revealed.

"Transforming the Mundane, Everyday Work of Parenting into A Spiritual Practice","Transforming the Mundane, Everyday Work of Parenting into A Spiritual PracticeThis following is an excerpt from the new book Nurture the Wow: Finding Spirituality in the Frustration, Boredom, Tears, Poop, Desperation, Wonder and Radical Amazement of Parenting by Danya Ruttenberg (Flatiron Books 2016)Jewish law suggests that you should not hold a child during prayer, lest she disturb your concentration, that you should not kiss your children in synagogue, to instill in yourself the idea that no love compares to love of God. If your child is crying, you should indicate‰ÛÓwithout speaking‰ÛÓto the child to stop crying, and if that doesn't work, you should walk away from her so that her crying does not disturb your prayer. Another source reminds fathers not to hold a diapered child before afternoon prayers, lest he become soiled and miss the start of services. All of this leads one Orthodox rabbi I know to remark that, as a result, he doesn't pray if he's alone with children.Obviously, traditional Jewish law wasn‰Ûªt written for or by those who are in the trenches of intimate care of small children. There is a not-very-implicit assumption that someone else, somewhere, is in charge of the sticky, huggy, needy, emotional little humans that, evidently, impede a person's ability to live a life of spiritual service. Spirituality and children are placed in opposing, incompatible spheres, and women are relegated, along with the children, away from wherever it is that they're keeping the spirituality.The idea that caring for children could be a core, crucial, even cornerstone aspect of one's spiritual and religious life, that loving and caring for them should be integrated, somehow, into one's spiritual and religious expression‰ÛÓwell, it's totally absent from this thinking. And this absence isn‰Ûªt specific to Judaism. Rather, it's the norm, in a lot of corners of the religious world. For example, a friend who is an Episcopal priest admits that ""most of us Christian parents (at least during liturgy) try to shush our children to keep them from 'disturbing' us or others."" Some churches and synagogues make efforts to be ""family-friendly,"" offering toys in the back corner of the worship space, babysitting, or separate kids' services in a different room. I both applaud these efforts and make ample use of them, myself. But it's true that they continue to perpetuate this notion that grown-up prayer‰ÛÓthe ""real"" spiritual life‰ÛÓis something that happens only when the kinder are otherwise occupied. That this kind of intentional spiritual connection cannot happen with children, or as I‰Ûªd like to suggest, through them.Across cultures, more often than not, men have been the authors of authoritative rulings and women have been at home with children. In some places, women were part of, say, a monastic tradition, but generally not mothering at the same time. The reasons for this are usually socio-economic, but at the end of the day, there are a whole set of experiences, issues, questions, and types of thinking that come out of doing the work of parenting that have not been integrated into classical discussions of prayer and religious practice in general.I wonder how various religious traditions might have formulated their approaches to prayer (and everything else) if they had been thinking about the realities of parenting small children from the beginning. And I wonder what these traditions could look like if the questions, challenges and types of thinking that parenting opens up were taken seriously and brought into the conversation, even at this late date.Sure, one could say that there‰Ûªs a tension. On the one hand, when people talk about religious disciplines, the implication is that a person has a practice‰ÛÓprayer, meditation, yoga, and so forth‰ÛÓthat gets done every day (or three times a week, or whatever), no matter what, and that the practice Does A Thing; it changes you. On the other, well, what parents know better than anybody, is that theories and principles are great, but when living the messy reality of life, they don‰Ûªt necessarily serve. And more than that, there might be profound truths to be learned from embracing the flux, the flow, as needed, as appropriate. What if there wasn‰Ûªt just one way to do this? What if a lot of ways were the right way?In my case, I‰Ûªd been carrying around the ultraviolet light, defining my religious expression by traditional rabbinic yardsticks, certain that it was the only possible option. It had served me well for a long time. But once I became a mother, I became more aware of other manifestations of light and discovered that, though sometimes my old means of spiritual practice still served me, there were other possibilities for connecting to the transcendent that, at times, spoke more deeply to who I had become, what I needed now.Sometimes my prayer‰ÛÓ offered up with intentionality into the great beyond‰ÛÓ involves deep contemplation of my son‰Ûªs ear, or arm. Sometimes it can be found in just being present with him, in snuggles or smiles or games or fielding questions. Sometimes I manifest it in a tiny cry‰ÛÓ ‰ÛÏhelp!‰Û‰ÛÓ barely perceptible even to me, when my kids‰Ûª needs are too big and overwhelming, when they‰Ûªre acting out, or even just when they‰Ûªre being normally spirited and rambunctious despite the fact that Mommy didn‰Ûªt sleep so well last night. Sometimes prayer involves other things‰ÛÓ singing with them, singing words of liturgy to them, saying words of liturgy to God.I don‰Ûªt think that how my prayer life has changed signifies that there‰Ûªs no wisdom to the tradition; rather, who I am and what I need has changed. Spiritual practice needs to be wide enough to accommodate expansions and contractions, shifts and changes in how we exist in the world. It has to be big enough for all the love we receive and give out. ‰ÛÏYou should not kiss your children in synagogue in order to instill in yourself the idea that no love compares to love of God‰Û? Are you kidding me? Th ere is enough room in our spiritual expressions not only for all of the love, but also for the hectic, distracted chaos that so often defines parenting, if we let it‰ÛÓif we are willing to expand our understanding of how much, how many kinds of, light exists in the world.","While the world's religious texts offer wisdom about love, devotion and sacrifice, they have almost nothing to say about handling the day-to-day challenges raising young kids.

"If Pope Francis were right on adultery, the Catholic Church would collapse","OpinionCatholic Church, Faith, Homosexuality, MarriageDecember 7, 2016 (TheCatholicThing) -- If you approve of bank robbery, you won‰Ûªt be able to condemn the act of shoplifting candy bars from a convenience store. I mean, you won‰Ûªt be able to do this if you are to be logically consistent. If you approve of a greater evil, you can‰Ûªt logically condemn lesser evils of the same genus.Likewise, if you approve of murder you cannot, if you wish to retain your reputation for logical consistency, condemn assault and battery.Again, if you are a Catholic who approves of adultery, you cannot very well condemn contraception and fornication.But in the now famous (perhaps I should say notorious?) Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis seems to approve of what has hitherto been regarded by the Catholic Church as adultery. He asserts ‰ÛÒ or at least he certainly seems to assert ‰ÛÒ that in certain circumstances a divorced-and-remarried Catholic should be allowed to consider his/her second marriage a true marriage. In other words, this divorced and remarried Catholic should be free to have sinless sexual relations with his/her spouse and should be free to receive Communion.This appears to contradict the plain words of Jesus himself, who said (unless the Gospels misreport him) that a married person who marries again while his/her first spouse is living commits adultery. Pope Francis, then, appears to be condoning in certain circumstances what Jesus himself calls adultery. And if the pope does this, how can he then not also condone (in certain circumstances) contraception and fornication?In short, doesn‰Ûªt the pope‰Ûªs blessing of adultery in certain circumstances imply the collapse of almost the entire structure of Catholic sexual morality? Apart from rape and child molestation, what sexual taboos would remain? And won‰Ûªt the priest or ex-priest who molested boys be able to argue that that kind of thing is allowable ‰ÛÏin certain circumstances‰Û?As for homosexual sodomy, the question of whether or not to condemn it would depend on whether it is more or less of a sin than adultery. If less, then the pope‰Ûªs permission of adultery in certain circumstances would also apply to homosexual behavior in certain circumstances. If more, then I suppose Catholics could still condemn homosexual conduct. But in reality, how could they do this if the whole structure of Catholic sexual morality had collapsed? If adultery and fornication deserve approval, who except a genuine homophobe would have the heart to disapprove of homosexual sodomy?You could still condemn abortion. For abortion, being homicide, is a worse sin than adultery. In the real world, however, everybody who approves of sexual freedom also approves of adultery. Catholics, beginning with popes and bishops, could still condemn abortion, but their hearts wouldn‰Ûªt be in it. De facto, they would approve of it.A defender of Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia might respond to what I have just said by pointing out that the pope is urging us to tolerate second marriages only in very rare and very narrow circumstances. He does not intend to open the door to the current secular ideal of nearly limitless sexual freedom. True enough. Likewise, the people who didn‰Ûªt repair the leak in the dike didn‰Ûªt intend to have the dike collapse and the land behind the dike flooded by seawater. After all, it was such a big dike and such a small leak. What harm could be done?Human beings, and I include Catholics in that category, are rational animals. This doesn‰Ûªt mean we are infallible; it doesn‰Ûªt even mean that we are very smart. But we tend to be consistent, at least in the long run. Once we adopt the principle, for instance, that ‰ÛÏall men are created equal,‰Û it will sooner or later dawn on us that we‰Ûªll have to get rid of slavery. Likewise, once Catholics agree with the pope that Jesus was in error when he expressed his absolutist views about the indissolubility of marriage, the whole structure of Catholic sexual morality will sooner or later collapse.And not just sexual morality. The whole structure of Catholicism will collapse. For if Jesus, who (we should remember) was no minor authority figure in the history of the Church, was wrong about marriage, who knows how many other things he was wrong about? And if Jesus was wrong, it is likely St. Paul and other New Testament writers were wrong. And if Jesus and Paul were wrong, who can be confident in the teachings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church? One small leak in the dike.Click ""like"" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!Now I don‰Ûªt write all this as an ultra-conservative. Not at all. If I were able to write the Church‰Ûªs law regarding marriage and sex, I‰Ûªd allow everybody at least one divorce; for good people often make big mistakes, especially when young. And I‰Ûªd have a tolerant attitude toward fornication and unmarried cohabitation, and I‰Ûªd be only mildly censorious toward an occasional adultery. And if, nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus had asked my advice, I would have recommended that he adopt my views, inspired as they are by the great moral wisdom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.For better or worse, however, the Catholic Church is not founded on the wisdom of the very enlightened and progressive present day. It is founded instead on what seems to a truly modern mind to be the provincial ‰ÛÏwisdom‰Û of an itinerant Palestinian preacher of the first century ‰ÛÒ a preacher we Catholics believe to be the all-perfect God incarnate. At least we say we believe this. If we really believe it, and if a disagreement opens up between Jesus and the pope on the question of the indissolubility of marriage, then, much though it grieves us to separate ourselves from such a good man as Pope Francis, we have no choice but to take the side of Jesus in this dispute.If we don‰Ûªt, the dike will collapse.Reprinted with permission from The Catholic Thing.",Doesn‰Ûªt the pope‰Ûªs blessing of adultery in certain circumstances imply the collapse of almost the entire structure of Catholic sexual morality?,['David Carlin'],http://bit.ly,0,0,0.5,1,12,1004,21,0,0,0.142857143,0.103959481,0.178571429,0
Idaho Planned Parenthood Suing Pro-Life Pregnancy Center Neighbors for Providing Healthcare,"Planned Parenthood (PP) has always been a controversial organization and a main target of the pro-life movement. While PP maintains they are vital for women‰Ûªs healthcare provision in this country, pro-life organizations regularly refute that assertion, saying that the country‰Ûªs largest abortion provider doesn‰Ûªt provide much care at all; it is certainly not a healthy place for a baby in the womb.The fight to publicly defund PP‰Ûªs abortion mills rages on, but PP also engages in strong-arm tactics and harassment in efforts to shut down alternative forms of women‰Ûªs and pregnancy healthcare.No one knows this better than Brandi Swindell, founder and director of the Stanton Healthcare Center in Boise, Idaho. Swindell is well known in the pro-life movement and established her non-profit, free pregnancy and healthcare center after an experience with a friend who had an abortion changed her heart forever. She saw the pain and emotional despair in the aftermath and knew there had to be a better way to help frightened women in desperate situations.After years of networking and fundraising, Swindell has been able to purchase outright a building to house Stanton services. Those building just so happen to be the direct neighbors of a Planned Parenthood. From the beginning the abortion provider was none too pleased to see the pregnancy center open right next door. They immediately began making petty complaints, even calling police when Swindell sent her assistant to take pictures of surrounding business‰Ûªs banners as to make sure their own met the size requirements. Their complaint? The assistant stepped on their grass.The police took one look at the slight, meek 22-year-old employee and told the Stanton staff to have a nice day.Over the years Stanton‰Ûªs PP neighbors have eased up on their complaints. Swindell is extremely careful to meet all of the requirements of the state and her business complex. When Stanton began a mobile healthcare clinic which sometimes parks in the commons area of the complex, it seemed a bridge too far. Last week Planned Parenthood slapped Stanton with a lawsuit alleging misuse and abuse of the common areas and claiming that the clinic invites people to use the common area to protest and cause nuisances.Swindell says her attorneys are currently reviewing the rules but are confident PP does not have appropriate grounds for the law suit.They‰Ûªre saying that we‰Ûªre inviting other groups to our property and they‰Ûªre blaming us for any nuisances brought by groups. We have very strict policies of code of conduct. Our brand is getting bigger and bigger and women are responding.That, claims Swindell, is really what PP finds the most threatening.While PP simply hands out referrals for many vital healthcare services like mammograms and health screenings, the Stanton mobile clinic provides a full array of medical services, free of charge. The 35 ft. state-of-the-art RV includes an exam room, ultrasound equipment, baby supplies, maternity clothes, prenatal vitamins and a host of other medical necessitities for women who are left out of the healthcare system.For now the clinic remains local to the center, but once the proper provisions are in place (which Swindell says should be in a short time) the clinic plans to bring their services directly to the homeless community in Boise. They will provide feminine hygiene products and healthcare to homeless women and will continue their support for the refugee community in ID as well. They also aim to travel to high schools and underserved rural areas across the state.But that‰Ûªs not all Stanton plans to do. After recently closing on their second building Swindell says they have plans to build a ‰ÛÏmega-clinic‰Û to provide the highest possible quality of life-affirming women‰Ûªs healthcare. This ‰ÛÒ she maintains- is the real reason PP suddenly brought suit. The abortion giant feels threatened. Swindell finds it all very ironic.Planned Parenthood is always fighting for access issues; they‰Ûªre always accusing the pro-life community of trying to block access and here they are trying to block access!For Stanton‰Ûªs part, the healthcare provider claims the only complaints they have ever received from the community in their business complex have come from Planned Parenthood, and in fact they have been welcomed openly as their services have driven up the value of the property.They support us. They like us there because we bring some calmness and peace. When Planned Parenthood comes in property value goes down and most businesses don‰Ûªt like it. We don‰Ûªt like abortion clinics because they kill children but they‰Ûªre not even wanted by the business community.Swindell maintains that Stanton‰Ûªs only goal is to provide quality care for women in need. She wants Stanton to directly compete with PP as an alternative that affirms life instead of takes lives. Stanton‰Ûªs only tactics are to be visible and accessible. Nothing more.‰ÛÏWhether people are pro-life or prochoice they need to know that Planned Parenthood thinks they have the authority to prevent us from helping women. They‰Ûªre trying to prevent us from doing good. That‰Ûªs disgusting.‰ÛStanton has set up a GoFundMe page for those who might like to donate in support of their legal defense. There is also information about resources and support opportunities on their website.","While complaining about pro-lifers denying healthcare access, the abortion giant seeks to deny healthcare access","['Kira Davis', 'Posted At Pm On December', 'Brandon Morse', 'Jennifer Van Laar', 'Alex Parker', 'Amelia Hamilton', 'T Laduke']",http://bit.ly,0,0,0.5,7,11,869,15,0,0,-0.1,0.09168254,0,0

DOJ Warns Landlords About Conducting Criminal Background Checks on Would-Be Renters,"The U.S. Justice Department is making it harder for landlords to exclude ex-convicts. (AP File Photo)(CNSNews.com) - As President Obama commutes the sentences of more and more prisoners, his Justice Department intends to make it harder for landlords to deny affordable housing to ex-convicts.The Justice Department announced on Tuesday that it is involving itself in a legal case in New York brought by a group that helps ""formerly incarcerated individuals"" find housing.The group complained that a 917-unit complex in Far Rockaway, Queens (N.Y.) had a policy of refusing to rent to individuals with prior convictions for felonies or misdemeanors other than traffic offenses. The plaintiff argues that this policy has an unjustified disparate impact against prospective African-American and Hispanic tenants, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.Although the Fair Housing Act does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants‰Ûª criminal records, the DOJ says ‰ÛÏcategorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.‰ÛIn other words, if landlords have policies banning ex-convicts in general, they could be in trouble if too many of those ex-cons happen to be black or ethnic minorities.

California adopts first U.S. energy-saving rules for computers,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California regulators on Wednesday adopted the nation‰Ûªs first mandatory energy efficiency rules for computers and monitors - devices that account for 3 percent of home electric bills and 7 percent of commercial power costs in the state.Apple's new MacBooks are displayed following an Apple event in San Francisco, California March 9, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File PhotoThe state Energy Commission said that when fully implemented the industry-backed plan will save consumers $373 million a year and conserve at least as much electricity annually as it takes to power all of San Francisco‰Ûªs households.Final approval at a meeting of the five-member commission in Sacramento capped several years spent developing the rules in collaboration with computer makers, consumer activists, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other environmental groups.The new rules will cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion to generate power by 700,000 tons a year, the NRDC said.The standards work by setting benchmarks for machines‰Ûª overall energy use - focusing on when they are turned on but left inactive - and leave manufacturers flexibility to choose which efficiency measures are employed to meet the standards, an approach aimed at fostering innovation.The rules drew support from nearly 40 companies represented by the Information Technology Industry Council, including such Silicon Valley giants as HP Inc and Intel Corp.HP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford called the standards ‰ÛÏgroundbreaking,‰Û describing them as ‰ÛÏambitious but achievable.‰Û‰ÛÏThis is a big deal,‰Û said Mark Cooper, a policy analyst for the Consumer Federation of America, adding that computer ownership per capita in California ranks second in the world behind Sweden.In California, computers and monitors draw an estimated 5,610 gigawatt-hours of energy per year - representing roughly 3 percent of residential electric bills and 7 percent of power costs for commercial users - much of that while the devices sit idle.The NRDC has said the amount of power consumed by computers and monitors will be reduced by a third once there is a complete turnover in existing stocks of those devices.The first phase of the rules takes effect in January 2019 for desktop, laptop and notebook computers. The standards kick in for workstations and small-scale servers in January 2018 and for computer monitors in July 2019.Video-game consoles, industrial computers, large-scale servers, tablets and other handheld devices are exempt.The standards will add about $14 to average retail costs of desktops, which are far less energy efficient than laptops, but will save consumers more than $40 in electric bills over five years, according to commission estimates.Over half of desktops typically in use in California now meet the first tier of the standards, which grow more stringent in 2021. Seventy-three percent of laptops already comply.Computer monitors have farther to go, with a compliance rate of just 14 percent among the 25 million units now installed in homes and businesses statewide.The latest rules could set a new standard for manufacturers everywhere by virtue of the size of the consumer market in California, which often leads the way in U.S. environmental initiatives.If the same standards are adopted nationwide, they could save U.S. consumers about $2.2 billion annually in electric bills while reducing energy generation by the equivalent output of seven coal-fired power plants, the NRDC said.Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Jonathan Oatis",California regulators on Wednesday adopted the nation's first mandatory energy efficiency rules for computers and monitors - devices that account for 3 percent of home electric bills and 7 percent of commercial power costs in the state.,['Steve Gorman'],http://reut.rs,0,0,0.5,1,8,563,37,1,0,0.25,0.048951049,0.125,0
Opinion | The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes,"‰ÛÏThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,‰Û Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. ‰ÛÏAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.‰ÛThe inequities contribute to the great American stagnation that I described in last week‰Ûªs column. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by G.E., Coca-Cola and others is money that can‰Ûªt be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can‰Ûªt be used to reduce their taxes and can‰Ûªt pay for schools, medical research or clean energy.There is another victim, too ‰ÛÓ one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can‰Ûªt take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren‰Ûªt as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven‰Ûªt persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can‰Ûªt easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon‰Ûªs rate.This system is cumbersome ‰ÛÓ causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance ‰ÛÓ and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors‰Ûª money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.Fortunately, there are signs of hope. Overhauling the corporate tax code is a rare issue on which the two parties have some common ground. If the Democrats take the Senate, Wyden is in line to lead the Finance Committee and says its first priority will be a big bill to improve roads, bridges and public transit systems (and create jobs). The second will be a corporate-tax bill to pay for the infrastructure. Both are good ideas.","It‰Ûªs time to stop companies ‰ÛÓ like Amazon, Boeing and Coca-Cola ‰ÛÓ from damaging the economy by legally shirking taxes.",[],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,0,8,318,20,0,0,0,0.204453024,0.2,0

(Photo: Handout)Becoming familiar with current life-expectancy statistics is the first order of business. ‰ÛÏThere are two aspects to addressing longevity,‰Û says Noel Abkemeier, the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. ‰ÛÏFirst, understanding it, and then planning an income that will last throughout life.‰ÛYou may live much longer than you think. ""There have been significant improvements in how long people survive in retirement, especially for wealthier Americans,‰Û says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management.Consider: Someone born in 1950 was expected to live to age 68.2. By contrast, someone born in 2014 was expected to live to age 78.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In other words, someone born today will need to fund an extra 10 years of retirement vs. someone born 66 years ago.What‰Ûªs more, life expectancy for those alive at age 65 has also increased dramatically. In 1950, a 65-year-old male could expect to live another 12.8 years. In 2014, a 65-year-old male could expect to live on average of 18 more years. The same is true for women. In 1950, a 65-year-o woman could expect to live another 15 years. By 2014, a 65-year-old woman could expect to live another 20.5 years.The Actuaries Longevity Illustrator can give you a good sense of how long you might live. Another resource is the Living to 100 life expectancy calculator.Financial advisers are starting to change assumptions about how long clients will live to make sure they don't outlive savings, according to a survey by InvestmentNews. Advisers are basing retirement-income plans on an average life span of 91 for men and 94 for women, according to the survey.‰ÛÏMany people do not understand longevity well,‰Û says Anna Rappaport, chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks. (Photo: Anna Rappaport Consulting)Consider the probabilities. One drawback with using life expectancy to plan for retirement is that it‰Ûªs just an average. One-half will die before life expectancy, and the other half after. So, the better way to approach the problem is to consider the probability of living to certain ages.Consider: There‰Ûªs a 25% chance that a 65-year-old man will live to 93; a 25% chance that a 65-year-old woman will live to 96; and for a couple 65 years old, there‰Ûªs a 25% chance that the surviving spouse lives to 98, according to SOA projections.All that said, Blanchett still thinks it makes more sense for people (and planners) to use a fixed time horizon, such as planning to age 95.Couples should consider their combined planning timeline. For couples who are 65 today, there‰Ûªs a 45% chance that a wife outlives her husband by five years and a 20% chance by 15 years, according to the SOA. ‰ÛÏDon‰Ûªt forget that assets need to last until the second to die for couples,‰Û says Rappaport.Consider your genes and behavior. ‰ÛÏSome factors that influence how long you live may be beyond your control,‰Û according to the SOA. ‰ÛÏOthers depend upon the choices you make every day. A successful retirement plan will address both.‰ÛHow will you manage longevity risk? There are some time-honored ways to deal with the risk of outliving your assets. Those include the use of annuities, a sound asset-drawdown plan, delaying Social Security to age 70 for the higher wage earner, and a reverse mortgage. Read Managing Post-Retirement Risks - A Guide to Retirement Planning.Remember, says Abkemeier, half of retirees will live longer (than life expectancy) and, to build in a cushion, individuals should plan for an additional five or more years when considering lifetime income.Robert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Katy Waldman‰Ûªs 10 Favorite Books of 2016,"Photo illustration by Slate. Images by Amazon* * *AdvertisementTraister was an indispensable voice during the 2016 election, writing about Hillary Clinton with warmth, lucidity, and insight. All three qualities are on display in her extraordinarily researched, cogently argued investigation into the rise of the single woman, which examines how unmarried women have long spearheaded social change and tracks the uneven line from past progressive movements to our current feminist flourishing. (I only wish she could have included a post-Trump addendum.) Especially notable is Traister‰Ûªs attention to the full racial and economic spectrum of womanhood and to the oft-underrated bonds of female friendship.Heat and Light by Jennifer Haigh. Ecco.In this sensitive and sweeping novel, Haigh returns to the fictional Bakerton, a mining village overtaken by ‰ÛÏfracking frenzy‰Û in the late 2010s. The locals are divided over whether to lease their land to an unscrupulous energy company; transient drillers flood into the bars with their lusts and sorrows; activists descend; salesmen make bargains with the townsfolk, the devil, and themselves. By the end of the book‰Ûªs 430 pages, Haigh‰Ûªs patient, cumulative arguments (about greed, faith, chance, and community) have achieved real sonority, and we feel fully invested in her individual characters. Heat and Light is that rare ‰ÛÏambitious social novel‰Û whose interlocking pieces are as vividly and precisely realized as its panoramic themes.AdvertisementModern Lovers by Emma Straub. Riverhead.Read Slate‰Ûªs review.As she demonstrated with her witty The Vacationers, Straub has charm to spare. In Modern Lovers, an ensemble novel about more-or-less forlorn fortysomethings in twee Brooklyn, her trademark nimbleness serves a story of startling emotional depth. Straub‰Ûªs adult characters (some of whom played together in a punk band) can‰Ûªt quite relinquish the dream of youth; their children don‰Ûªt know how to grow up, either. Disruptions small and large break across their interconnected paths, and there is deep satisfaction in watching an author as psychologically astute and empathetic as Straub play out their various responses. But the purest joys of the novel come from rooting for these relatably rudderless people as they attempt to sail into maturity with a modicum of grace.Moonglow by Michael Chabon. Harper.Read Slate‰Ûªs review.Again, you may be shocked‰ÛÓshocked!‰ÛÓto learn that the latest novel from Pulitzer Prize‰ÛÒwinning author Chabon, a shimmering ‰ÛÏmemoir‰Û about his grandparents, is among the year‰Ûªs best. But the pleasure of surrendering to Chabon‰Ûªs remarkable skills as a storyteller can‰Ûªt be overstated. He excels on every level: his gorgeous, funny, looping sentences; his knack for the harlequin escapade; his deft swerves into emotional honesty and power; his intuitive mastery of suspense, tension, and release. Plus, American hero Ramon the cat deserves all the accolades for his third-act moment of bravery. Go Ramon!AdvertisementMy Name Is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout. Random House.In Strout‰Ûªs deceptively quiet hands, a line of dialogue can seem simple or commonplace until it begins to burn, a glowing coal plucked from the furnace of some character‰Ûªs psyche. My Name Is Lucy Barton is a masterpiece of slow-dawning meaning, an interrogation of family relationships that takes as its occasion an older woman‰Ûªs visit to the bedside of her convalescent daughter. (And that‰Ûªs all I‰Ûªm going to say about the plot!)Night of the Animals by Bill Broun. Ecco.In the England of 2052, an authoritarian king lords over a broken, drug-addled society, while the internet plays directly on people‰Ûªs corneas and suicide cultists seek salvation in the murder of animals. Homeless, nonagenarian addict Cuthbert believes he can save the world by releasing the creatures in the London Zoo, a task that plunges him deep into Celtic myth, the intrigues of the dystopian police state, and the scattered phantasms of his buried past. Broun‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏBrexit novel,‰Û acquiring new resonance under the sign of Trump, is an eerie, wildly original debut‰ÛÓa blur of beauty and madness, like van Gogh‰Ûªs Starry Night.AdvertisementThis novel‰ÛÓabout an academic malcontent; his accidentally revolutionary mother; and the constellation of students, family members, blowhard politicians, reactionary cops, video game addicts, ghosts, and Norwegian hobgoblins encircling them‰ÛÓis a Thanksgiving banquet of a book, a narrative table groaning with dishes both delicious and overdone. Hill, a gifted satirist whose lambasting of special-snowflake millennials and escapist gamer nerds can feel too broad, slips in tone from intelligent and realist to zanily experimental to lush and dreamy. His 600-page opus is an extravaganza of talent, a beautiful and idiosyncratic mess that for all its flashiness finds its most expressive voice when exploring basic human themes: love, anger, loneliness, regret.In Winters‰Ûª speculative portrait of present-day America, slavery persists in four states (the ‰ÛÏHard Four‰Û), and hypercompetent government agents track down fugitives with the amoral aplomb of James Bond. One such operative is Victor, a freed slave whose nightmarish past keeps erupting into his detective work. The book is profligate with its noir tropes, funny, gripping, imaginative, and inexorable as it gradually unmasks the unthinkable evil at its core. The storyline, in other words, doubles as a descent‰ÛÓand there is always further down to go.AdvertisementWhitehead, who won this year‰Ûªs National Book Award for fiction, isn‰Ûªt hurting for laurels‰ÛÓand yet it‰Ûªs hard to imagine drafting a list of 2016‰Ûªs mightiest books without including this phantasmagorical slash into the dark gut of American racism. Cora, an escaped slave, travels through the South on a literal subterranean train, each stop an object lesson in a different ghoulish facet of white supremacy. Her resolve and dignity are moving‰ÛÓbut it‰Ûªs the author‰Ûªs playfulness and unpredictability that elevate this traditional tale of hardship into something singular, fugitive, and strange.This memoir, from a literary-minded neurosurgeon who is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in his 30s, is poetic and generous, intimate and profound. In clear and flowing prose, Kalanithi describes his self-formation as a doctor and then the evaporation of that identity as he becomes, again, a patient, starving for time. If some sections of the book are rougher or more abstract than others, the overall work recalls a world of almost pre-Christian luminousness, in which classical concepts like virtue, honor, and excellence still have purchase, chance or fate reigns supreme, and no person can evade the dark forever.---Heat and Light: A Novel Check out this great listen on Audible.com.

Why Glenn Beck Really Hates Steve Bannon,"There has been something delightfully ironic about watching Glenn Beck become one of the sanest voices in conservative media over this past year.The Texas-based right-wing radio host and founder of The Blaze website‰ÛÓwho once declared that Barack Obama has a ‰ÛÏdeep-seated hatred for white people‰Û‰ÛÓwas #NeverTrump from the beginning of the GOP primaries. He initially threw his weight behind Ted Cruz and didn‰Ûªt budge from his anti-Trump stance even after Cruz decided to endorse the man who insulted his wife and blamed his father for the JFK assassination.As Election Day approached, Beck openly toyed with the idea of voting for Hillary Clinton, criticized Trump during the third presidential debate for his baffling incoherence on abortion, and called FBI Director James Comey ‰ÛÏirresponsible‰Û for tossing an October grenade into the race at the last minute.Throughout the race, however, Beck has reserved his harshest words for Steve Bannon, who just this weekend was named President-elect Trump‰Ûªs chief strategist. But is Beck‰Ûªs great moral outrage over the self-proclaimed leader of the alt-right as selfless as it seems? Or is it personal?It was all the way back in February of this year, when Cruz still had a chance and months before Trump had hired Bannon to serve as his campaign CEO, that Beck launched his attack.‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm telling you that I believe that Bannon thinks he‰Ûªs either going to be the chief of staff or he‰Ûªs going to be the next Roger Ailes,‰Û Beck said, presciently. He accused the Breitbart executive chairman of ‰ÛÏtaking orders from a political candidate‰Û and ‰ÛÏreworking your entire site to promote the lies of a specific candidate without any kind of truth behind these things.‰Û In Beck‰Ûªs view, that made Bannon more like Joseph Goebbels than Ailes.‰ÛÏAndrew Breitbart would be spinning in his grave right now,‰Û Beck said, referring to the late founder of Breitbart.com.But as it turns out, neither Breitbart nor Bannon were big fans of Beck, who launched The Blaze as a direct competitor to Breitbart after he was let go by Ailes and Fox News.A few months after Beck started broadcasting his GBTV show online in 2011, Andrew Breitbart went on Steve Bannon‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏVictory Sessions‰Û podcast, and the two men spent a good deal of time trashing their new competition.Beck had made some provocative comments comparing Newt Gingrich to Barack Obama and suggested Tea Partiers only liked Gingrich because he was white, and Breitbart and Bannon accused Beck of ‰ÛÏrace-baiting.‰Û‰ÛÏIn the past, Beck has made a lot of mistakes, and his supporters come out and try to defend him, because Beck is a coward and will not defend himself when he makes a mistake or lies about a person or steals content,‰Û Breitbart said.Egging him on, Bannon replied, ‰ÛÏHold on, I want to go back over this: You‰Ûªre saying that Glenn Beck‰Ûªs a coward, Glenn Beck‰Ûªs a liar, and you‰Ûªre saying that Glenn Beck steals material from people?‰ÛGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

He went on to say that Beck has been known to ‰ÛÏtake countless bloggers‰Ûª content, to turn it into book gold, to turn it into chalkboard gold, his infamous chalkboards,‰Û an allegation explored in detail by The Daily Caller‰Ûªs Matthew Boyle earlier that year.Asked by Bannon what he would like to see Beck do next, Breitbart said, ‰ÛÏAt this point, I don‰Ûªt care what he does because he‰Ûªs dead to me.‰ÛFive years later, Bannon had officially joined the Trump campaign and Beck was openly calling him ‰ÛÏquite possibly the most dangerous guy in all of American politics‰Û and a ‰ÛÏhorrible, despicable human being.‰Û His assertion that Bannon uses the ‰ÛÏDark Web‰Û to exact revenge on his enemies landed Beck on Breitbart‰Ûªs list of the ‰ÛÏ six dumbest claims ‰Û journalists made about Bannon.After news broke that Bannon would be joining Trump in the White House, Beck once again warned against Bannon‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏclear tie to white nationalists,‰Û adding, ‰ÛÏHe‰Ûªs a terrifying man.‰ÛThese sentiments were echoed on Monday by Dana Loesch, who sued Breitbart‰ÛÓciting an ‰ÛÏincreasingly hostile‰Û work environment‰ÛÓbefore joining The Blaze, during her live show. ‰ÛÏSteve Bannon puts himself above everything,‰Û she said of her former boss. ‰ÛÏI just don‰Ûªt think this is a good fit for the country. Maybe it is for Steve Bannon, but it‰Ûªs not a good fit for the country.‰Û Loesch suggested that Bannon will enter the White House with ‰ÛÏvengeance‰Û and ‰ÛÏpettiness‰Û in his heart, which should alone ‰ÛÏdisqualify‰Û him from advising the president.When Beck first joked that Bannon was angling to be Trump‰Ûªs chief of staff earlier this year, he had no idea how right he would end up being. That job may have ended up going to Reince Priebus, but it was Bannon who got top billing on the official press release. In the end, Bannon‰Ûªs ambitions far exceeded being the next Roger Ailes.Now, a man who has never hid his disgust for Beck is about to become arguably the second most powerful person in Washington, if not the country. And at the same time, Trump and his team have made every indication that they intend to act hostilely toward a ‰ÛÏrigged‰Û media that they believe has been biased against them from the beginning.It is yet another irony that Beck now finds himself in their crosshairs along with the rest of us.",The Blaze founder has become an unlikely voice of reason on the right.

BREAKING: Top Trump Adviser Drops Bombshell... Wednesday Is the END of Hillary's Campaign,"One of Donald Trump‰Ûªs top surrogates made news when he intimated that a WikiLeaks release of information on Hillary Clinton, which he says will happen Wednesday, could finish her campaign.In a Twitter posting this weekend, Trump adviser and Republican political consultant Roger Stone said that the information, which he says will be released Wednesday, will somehow end Hillary Clinton‰Ûªs campaign.‰ÛÏWednesday @Hillary Clinton is done. #Wikileaks,‰Û Stone tweeted.https://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/782443074874138624 ?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwThe information was originally scheduled to be released Tuesday, but NBC News (via Heat Street) reported WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ordered the release pushed back due to ‰ÛÏsecurity concerns.‰ÛTRENDING: How Trump Brilliantly Screwed Over Red State Dem Senators with Kavanaugh NominationThose security concerns are hardly illusory, especially when one is dealing with the left. Back in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a huge trove of classified diplomatic cables that embarrassed the Obama administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal commentator Bob Beckel recommended that Assange be assassinated, suggesting during a Fox News television appearance that someone ‰ÛÏshoot the son of a bitch!‰ÛAssange also intimated after his organization‰Ûªs leak of Democratic National Committee documents that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich had been one of the organization‰Ûªs sources. According to The Hill, that hasn‰Ûªt stopped the organization, which has said it plans to release more information on Clinton before the Nov. 8 election.It is unknown whether the delayed information will actually be released on Wednesday, but Stone seems to believe, from his tweet, that it will be.WikiLeaks‰Ûª most significant information dump on the Democrats, which occurred right before the Democratic National Convention in July, confirmed that the party organization was operating as a de facto arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign and was actively working to undermine the insurgent campaign of socialist Sen.

"WATCH: Punk Tries to Ruin Concert for Vets, So Luke Bryan PUNCHES Him From Stage","Country singer Luke Bryan performed at Nashville‰Ûªs Bridgestone Arena Wednesday as part of Charlie Daniel‰Ûªs 80th birthday all-star Volunteer Jam ‰ÛÓ a concert that raised money for military veterans, Taste of Country reported.Sadly, one concert-goer decided to make an obscene gesture, and Bryan didn‰Ûªt take it sitting down ‰ÛÓ he punched the man from the stage.In the middle of a song, a man in the front row decided to give Bryan the middle finger. Bryan reportedly yelled ‰ÛÏCome on,‰Û before he went ahead and punched the man, according to Us Weekly. Bryan then gathered himself and went on with his performance.Take a look at a video of the altercation below both on Twitter and an up-close version posted to YouTube:https://twitter.com/_kelseymeador/status/804188938265042944 ?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwAfter the altercation, Rolling Stone posted a statement from Bryan‰Ûªs team:‰ÛÏA man in (the) front row was making crude hand gestures toward Luke during his performance. It was insulting not only to him, but more importantly to the men, women and families sitting around him who were there to support and celebrate Charlie Daniels and the efforts of raising money for the military veterans ‰ÛÓ some of who were in the audience. The concert security personnel saw the man‰Ûªs disruptive actions of the event and he was escorted out.‰ÛThe obscene gesture was apparently the tip of the iceberg, according to Rolling Stone, which reported that there were two hecklers in the crowd, one with an insulting sign that referenced Bryan‰Ûªs famous tight jeans.Although it‰Ûªs not a great idea to punch a guy in the front row ‰ÛÓ if only for your own safety ‰ÛÓ it is understandable why Bryan did it. The event was meant to raise money for vets and the man‰Ûªs actions were extremely disrespectful.Fortunately, as Taste of Country reported, the man was escorted out by security and the event wasn‰Ûªt hampered ‰ÛÓ $240,000 was raised that night for the Journey Home Project which works to help veteran‰Ûªs lives in a variety of ways.To behave like that person did is unacceptable ‰ÛÓ especially at an event to raise money for veterans. There‰Ûªs no excuse for it, and while Bryan probably should have kept his cool, sometimes people reap what the sow.TRENDING: ABC News Lambasted After Posting Incredibly Biased Statement on Trump‰Ûªs SCOTUS NomineeH/T Independent Journal ReviewPlease share this post on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.What's your take on what Bryan did?

Samsung raided in Park corruption probe,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ms Park has seen her approval ratings plummet amid the scandalSouth Korean authorities have raided the offices of Samsung and the national pension fund as part of a corruption investigation linked to the president.They are probing whether Park Geun-hye pressured the fund to support a Samsung merger, said the Yonhap news agency.In return, Samsung is alleged to have given financial favours to Ms Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, Yonhap said.The scandal has led to growing calls for Ms Park's resignation, but she has said the allegations are ""fantasy"".Ms Choi, who has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud, is accused of using her close relationship with Ms Park to obtain favours and funds for her own gain.Earlier this week prosecutors said Ms Park had a ""considerable"" role in the scandal.The allegations have enraged the South Korean public, and caused Ms Park's approval ratings to plummet. However, she has resisted the calls for her to resign and has yet to agree to be questioned by investigators.Her spokesman rejected the prosecutors' case as speculation built on ""a house of fantasy"".Image copyright EPA Image caption South Koreans have staged demonstrations calling for Ms Park's resignationSamsung's offices had already been raided over related allegations.Wednesday's raid had to do with a merger last year between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries.The deal went through despite significant opposition from shareholders, who said it would hurt minority shareholders while benefiting the family of Samsung's group owner Lee Kun-hee.South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), which owns stakes in both companies, sealed the deal by voting in favour of it.Prosecutors allege that Samsung gave ‰âÂ2.8m euros ($3.1m;å£2.5m) to a company co-owned by Ms Choi and her daughter, in return for Ms Park's support for the deal.Samsung was also among several conglomerates that gave millions of dollars to two non-profit foundations owned by Ms Choi, after the latter allegedly pressured them for donations.Samsung and the pension fund confirmed the raids without giving further details.Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption At the centre of the probe is Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Park Geun-hyeMs Park is accused of giving Ms Choi inappropriate access to government policy-making and decisions.She has since acknowledged that she committed lapses, and apologised twice on national television.Separately on Wednesday, Ms Park's office confirmed a report that they had bought hundreds of Viagra pills on behalf of the president.A spokesman told reporters that the drug, better known for treating erectile dysfunction among men, was meant to help Ms Park and her staff cope with high-altitude sickness during trips to Africa.",Prosecutors have raided Samsung and the national pension fund as part of a corruption probe.,[],http://www.bbc.com,0,0,0,0,6,455,15,0,0,0,0.109722222,0,0

"Sorry, I gotta get this off of my chest.","They deserve so much better than Trump.Anybody who knows me knows that I‰Ûªm not easily offended. Part of it is past job and sports decisions I‰Ûªve made. If you‰Ûªre a standup comic and you can‰Ûªt take occasional taunts and heckling, you‰Ûªre in the wrong business. I had a drunk charge the stage one time. The bouncer caught him, and I stood there blowing kisses at him while the bouncer dragged him out and the crowd laughed like hell. Don‰Ûªt play organized hockey, even at the college or social club level if you can‰Ûªt take boos and nasty comments from the stands. And if you‰Ûªre gonna cry every time your coach screams that you‰Ûªre a dumb shit, you need a new hobby.But now I‰Ûªm highly offended. Trumps‰Ûª wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier today made my skin crawl. I come from a military family. My father was a veteran, I couldn‰Ûªt stop sobbing when they gave me the flag that draped his casket at Lincoln National cemetery. I have an uncle who died in a jeep accident in Germany on active duty, and a great uncle who lies at rest somewhere in the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, I‰Ûªve seen his name on the wall of the memorial. I lost two close friends who were coworkers in Afghanistan, I attended both of the funerals. Even though I‰Ûªll be 60 next month, I still carry my Vietnam era draft card in my wallet. This is personal to me.It turned my stomach to watch that fat, arrogant orange penguin, who has sacrificed nothing and no one in his life, and who has so little respect for our brave troops that he referred to his swinging lifestyle in New York in the ‰Û÷70s as his own personal Vietnam, even though he received phony deferments to keep from going to Vietnam, wrapping his tiny fingers around that wreath and placing it in front of the tomb of brave, anonymous men who sacrificed everything so that he could grab women by the crotch with impunity. But what really made my blood boil was when a commentator said that the next time he does that at Arlington, he‰Ûªll be saluting instead of putting his hand over his heart! Needless to say, I won‰Ûªt be watching any of those future ceremonies for the next four years.You all know that I have dug into Mein Furor pretty extensively for the last almost 20 months, and usually I just roll with the punches, by trying to heap scorn and sarcasm about everything he says or does. There is so much to hate about him that this website would have to expand to take the diaries if they were all to be chronicled. But these next four years are going to be rough for me, watching him pudge waddle down the steps of Marine One and throwing a salute to the guard soldier at the bottom of the steps, a man who would fight and die for him if Trump ordered it, and a man that Donald J. Trump couldn‰Ûªt give a shit less about.Sorry for the rant, but this has been eating at me for almost three hours now, and I just had to get it out. I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªll write about tomorrow, I had thought about not even turning on the t.v., but somehow I‰Ûªm sure I will, for no better reason than to find something to mock. Thanks to all who read for putting up with this rant!","Anybody who knows me knows that I‰Ûªm not easily offended. Part of it is past job and sports decisions I‰Ûªve made.

Eight people 'as rich as poorest half',"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Superyachts are the calling card of some ultra-wealthy individualsThe world's eight richest individuals have as much wealth as the 3.6bn people who make up the poorest half of the world, according to Oxfam.The charity said its figures, which critics have queried, came from improved data, and the gap between rich and poor was ""far greater than feared"".The richest eight include Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett.Mark Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said Oxfam should focus instead on ways to boost growth.""As an 'anti-poverty' charity, Oxfam seems to be strangely preoccupied with the rich,"" said the director-general of the free market think tank.For those concerned with ""eradicating absolute poverty completely"", the focus should be on measures that encourage economic growth, he added.Ben Southwood, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, said it was not the wealth of the world's rich that mattered, but the welfare of the world's poor, which was improving every year.""Each year we are misled by Oxfam's wealth statistics. The data is fine - it comes from Credit Suisse - but the interpretation is not.""Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Economist Amartya Sen tells Radio 4's Today that economic inequality must be tackled'Elite gathering'Oxfam's report coincides with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, a Swiss ski resort. The annual event attracts many of the world's top political and business leaders.Katy Wright, Oxfam's head of global external affairs, said the report helped the charity to ""challenge the political and economic elites"".""We're under no illusions that Davos is anything other than a talking shop for the world's elite, but we try and use that focus,"" she added.The world's eight richest billionaires1. Bill Gates (US): co-founder of Microsoft (net worth $75bn)2. Amancio Ortega (Spain): founder of Zara owner Inditex (net worth $67bn)3. Warren Buffett (US): largest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway (net worth $60.8bn)4. Carlos Slim Helu (Mexico): owner of Grupo Carso (net worth $50bn)5. Jeff Bezos (US): founder and chief executive of Amazon (net worth $45.2bn)6. Mark Zuckerberg (US): co-founder and chief executive of Facebook (net worth $44.6bn)7. Larry Ellison (US): co-founder and chief executive of Oracle (net worth $43.6bn)8. Michael Bloomberg (US): owner of Bloomberg LP (net worth $40bn)Source: Forbes billionaires' list, March 2016UK economist Gerard Lyons said focusing on extreme wealth ""does not always give the full picture"" and attention should be paid to ""making sure the economic cake is getting bigger"".However, he said Oxfam was right to single out companies that it believed fuelled inequality with business models that were ""increasingly focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives"".Oxfam's Ms Wright said economic inequality was fuelling a polarisation in politics, citing Donald Trump's election as US president and the Brexit vote as examples.'Fair share'""People are angry and calling out for alternatives. They're feeling left behind because however hard they work they can't share in their country's growth,"" she said.The charity is calling for ""a more human economy"" and is urging governments to crack down on executive pay and tax evasion and impose higher taxes on the wealthy.It also wants business leaders to pay a ""fair share of tax"" and has urged companies to pay staff the ""living wage"", which is higher than the government's National Living Wage.Oxfam has produced similar reports for the past four years. In 2016 it calculated that the richest 62 people in the world had as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population.The number had fallen to just eight this year because more accurate data was now available, Oxfam said.It was still the case that the world's richest 1% had as much wealth as the rest of the world combined, Oxfam said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla ChanSome of the eight richest billionaires have given away tens of billions of dollars. In 2000 Bill Gates and his wife Melinda set up a private foundation that has an endowment of more than $44bn.In 2015 Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan pledged to give away 99% of their net worth in their lifetimes, which equated to about $45bn based on the value of Facebook shares at the time.It takes cash and assets worth $71,600 to get into the top 10%, and $744,396 to be in the top 1%.Oxfam's report is based on data from Forbes and the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth datebook, which gives the distribution of global wealth going back to 2000.The survey uses the value of an individual's assets, mainly property and land, minus debts, to determine what he or she ""owns"". The data excludes wages or income.The methodology has been criticised as it means that a student with high debts, but with high future earning potential, for example, would be considered poor under the criteria used.",Oxfam research finds the eight richest billionaires have as much wealth as 3.6 billion people combined.,"['Business Reporter', 'Bbc News', 'In Davos', 'Katie Hope']",http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,4,7,844,16,0,0,0.104166667,0.149587647,0.2,0

Over 1 million people are still trapped in the city.""Unfortunately, it‰Ûªs very difficult for humanitarian agencies like Oxfam to get into Mosul itself,"" Kai Tabacek, Oxfam's digital press officer said in an interview to RT. He returned just a month ago from the area of Irbil, which is 90 kilometers from Mosul.Read moreAccording to Tabacek, some 100,000 people have managed to flee the violence in Mosul, yet approximately 10 times more are still in the city and facing a ‰ÛÏdire humanitarian situation.‰ÛAfter almost two months of operation to liberate Mosul ‰ÛÏwe have more than 100,000 people who have fled the city and surrounding areas,‰Û the Oxfam representative said. ‰ÛÏStill more than a million people, we believe, are trapped inside Mosul and they are at risk from being caught by sniper fire, explosive devices. And it's really important that all sides in this conflict provide safe escape routes for those people to leave.‰ÛMosul was captured by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) back in 2014 and later turned into a self-proclaimed capital of the jihadists in Iraq. The operation to retake the key city started on October 17, with tens of thousands of Iraqi military, special forces and militias taking part. The mission is also supported by the US-led international coalition.‰ÛÏThe situation is not great, particularly with winter arriving in Iraq,‰Û Tabacek said. Yet ‰ÛÏso far most of the displaced families leaving Mosul have been able to access some form of assistance from Oxfam and from others [humanitarian organizations].""Read moreThe Oxfam press officer also noted that it‰Ûªs crucial for all sides to avoid using heavy weaponry inside the city since it puts civilian lives at risk.‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs very worrying when there is a conflict that close to where the people are living and we‰Ûªve seen in other places and in Mosul so far, the way ISIS seem willing to use people as human shields,‰Û Tabacek warned.He also said that liberating Mosul won‰Ûªt automatically eliminate the humanitarian crisis in the area: ‰ÛÏMore than 3 million people that are displaced in northern Iraq. And that‰Ûªs not only from Mosul, that's a number of other areas that have been recaptured in the last few years. This is a crisis that is not going to go away anytime soon,‰Û Tabacek said.Meanwhile, the operation to retake Mosul has slowed down in the past weeks since the Iraqi army and militias are going deeper into the city. In addition, an early December report by Debkafiles, a military intelligence news site with links to the Israeli military, said Islamic State is now mulling to stay put in their Iraqi stronghold. According to the report, a delegation of IS commanders arrived in Mosul on December 4, to discuss synchronizing the city defenses with those of Raqqa in Syria. Mosul commanders have ‰ÛÏchanged course about leaving the city and decided to stay put,‰Û the paper said.READ MORE: Pentagon pens ground op plans for Mosul as campaign falters ‰ÛÒ DEBKA","Humanitarian organizations face serious difficulties in delivering aid to people inside Iraq‰Ûªs Mosul amid the US-backed operation against Islamic State, Oxfam spokesman who returned from Iraq told RT.

Restoring Free Speech: The Trump Effect,"Trump has Americans timidly coming out from the shadows; feeling a little less afraid of exercising their Constitutional right to express their religious and political viewsRestoring Free Speech: The Trump EffectYears ago, Rush Limbaugh coined the term, ‰ÛÏLow-info Voters.‰Û The term perfectly describes Americans, like 95% of my family, who only get their news from the mainstream media. Consequently, low-info voters do not know that the mainstream media is not fair and balanced. The mainstream media has become strong-arm enforcers of political correctness and operatives of the Democrat Party; 100% focused and committed to furthering the socialist/progressive agenda. Yes, I remember when I was a kid my black Baltimore City firefighter dad told me, ‰ÛÏThe Republicans are for the rich and the Democrats are for the little guy; the working man.‰ÛA few years ago, I was able to convince my 89-year-old dad that this ‰ÛÏain‰Ûªt‰Û his Democrat Party of his youth. Dad‰Ûªs Democrat Party has been hijacked by old hippies. They reject Christianity while vowing to arrest anyone speaking badly of Islam. They use public schools to teach our kids to despise all things traditional, wholesome, patriotic and good. They are the ones who have, for the most part, made it criminal to publicly say you believe marriage should remain as it has been for thousands of years and how God intended; between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24). They are the ones banning Nativity scenes and banning saying ‰ÛÏMerry Christmas.‰Û They are the ones banning teachers addressing students as boys and girls, claiming gender distinctions are intolerant, discriminatory and bigoted. They are the ones pushing the extinction of blacks via a disproportionate high number of black abortions. This it why it continues to frost me when low-info idiots in my black ‰ÛÏChristian‰Û family continue to pledge their brain-dead loyalty to Democrats while calling me their Uncle Tom relative. The Left uses a highly effective tactic. They brand any push-back to them cramming their progressive agenda down our throats ‰ÛÏextremism.‰Û This tactic works great with so many low-info voters.Here is how it works. The Left says they want burly men with beards, dressed like lumberjacks to be permitted to use women restrooms if they inwardly feel like a woman that day. Husbands, fathers and brothers across America politically said, No-way. We are not allowing grown men in restrooms with our little girls, wives and mothers. Government mandating this insane restroom policy and Leftist businesses like Target embracing it has led to rapes and molestation in women restrooms. And yet, guess who the mainstream media and Democrats attack, calling them extremist? Answer: All who oppose men in women restrooms. In an attempt to demonize and silence American‰Ûªs common-sense disagreement, the Left claims anyone opposing men in women restrooms hates homosexuals and want to see them tortured and murdered. If you oppose the Left removing crosses from memorials, removing the Ten Commandments from public buildings, banning Nativity scenes and banning saying ‰ÛÏMerry Christmas‰Û, the Left claims you‰Ûªre an extremist who hates homosexuals, suppresses women and want to cram your religion down everyone‰Ûªs throat. Do you see how the Left‰Ûªs extremism tactic works? They are the aggressors, but call you an extremist when you simply say, ‰ÛÏNo.‰Û Clearly, the Left has launched a pedal-to-the-metal campaign to cram their progressive agenda down our throats. For example: A Zales jewelry TV commercial featured a lesbian wedding. Homosexuals are only 2% of the population. So why is featuring a lesbian wedding necessary? Fearful to admit it, most Americans still instinctively know marriage is between one man and one woman. But if they dare say it out loud, the Left will try to destroy them by branding their belief in tradition and biblical teaching extreme; outrageously claiming they hate homosexuals and want to see them tortured and murdered. The Left‰Ûªs tactic of branding the slightest opposition ‰ÛÏextremism‰Û has silenced many. I believe Trump in the WH has already begun liberating Americans from the Left‰Ûªs tyranny of political correctness; muzzling free speech. I realize the Left will distort my statement to mean Trump has opened the flood gates to express hate. Nonsense.Continued below... Leftists are boldly, relentlessly spewing hate against Jesus, Christians, Republicans, Conservatives (black and white), white people and police The truth is Leftists are the ones who boldly and relentlessly spew hate against Jesus, Christians, Republicans, Conservatives (black and white), white people and police. Heck, Leftists have even given marching orders to their minions, declaring it open season on killing whites and police. Have you heard the slightest rebuke from the mainstream media? No. All I am saying is Trump has Americans timidly coming out from the shadows; feeling a little less afraid of exercising their Constitutional right to express their religious and political views. And that brothers and sisters is good for all Americans.Only YOU can save CFP from Social Media Suppression.

Opinion | The Senate Bathroom Angle,"We are sorely in need of some cheerful news out of Washington, so I‰Ûªm going to tell you Barbara Mikulski‰Ûªs story about the Senate bathrooms.Almost every veteran woman legislator, in every level of government, has a story about the shortage of bathroom facilities at work. Really, there needs to be a book on this. It could have a happy ending, and none of the chapters would involve Russian attempts to manipulate an election.Mikulski, 80, has served in Congress longer than any other woman in history. She‰Ûªs retiring this month after representing Maryland for 30 years in the Senate. Before that she spent 10 years in the House. She was a social worker who got into Democratic politics during a battle to stop a planned highway that was threatening the ethnic Baltimore neighborhoods she loved. It was an unusual career route at the time, but she was an unusual person. ‰ÛÏOne of the things they said was that I didn‰Ûªt look the part,‰Û Mikulski, who is 4-foot-11, recalled. ‰ÛÏ‰Û_ You know, chunky and I have a definite blue-collar style, so I wasn‰Ûªt to the manner born, to the trust fund inherited.‰ÛThe classic way for a woman to win a seat in the Senate was to follow a famous male relative. Many of her predecessors were widows who succeeded their husbands. Nancy Kassebaum, the only other woman in the Senate when Mikulski arrived, was the daughter of the Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon.","We are sorely in need of some cheerful news out of Washington, so I‰Ûªm going to tell you Barbara Mikulski‰Ûªs story.",[],http://www.nytimes.com,0,0,0.5,0,6,244,21,0,0,0,0.2075,0.4,0

The Every Student Succeeds Act will Fail - The Boston Globe,"Across the country, schools and school districts have begun to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. The law is the latest reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first passed in 1965. Yet, despite the fanfare and promise to usher in a new era, this newest version ‰ÛÓ like so many federal and state schemes to implement high standards for student learning ‰ÛÓ will fail. The regulatory process associated with implementation will inevitably corrupt the law‰Ûªs intent.I have witnessed this again and again in my 35 years as a teacher ‰ÛÓ a front-row seat from which I have viewed the deadening impact on schools and classrooms of standards as regulatory tools. At the same time, however, I have also been inspired by the inventive ways that school-level educators and communities have used similar standards to foster powerful learning.In 1989, I joined a circle of colleagues and parents frustrated by the focus on testing of the well-regarded high school in our suburban community near Albany, N.Y. At the time, New York State‰Ûªs curriculum consisted of thick manuals with long lists of learning objectives and a battery of tests, the vaunted Regents Exams. Our small group asked: How can we engage students in learning more fully beyond a narrow desire to ace the exam?AdvertisementOver the course of several years we designed and launched an alternative school-within-a-school, in which tests took a back seat to projects designed to simulate real world problems. Each semester, students in the Bethlehem Lab School presented their work before a panel of adults drawn from the community. The high stakes of a juried exhibition pushed our students to focus, and the complex nature of the work forced them to think more deeply and broadly than they were accustomed.Get Arguable in your inbox: Jeff Jacoby on everything from politics to pet peeves to the passions of the day.

We chose this lower status designation as an entire school to free ourselves to create a more demanding curriculum, based on New York State‰Ûªs own learning standards. It turned out that at the back of all those thick curriculum books put out by the state stood an elegantly simple list of 10 goals. It fit on one page. It was our constitution. And though the Regents curriculum was, theoretically, based on the 10 goals, the process of parsing out learning objectives in each subject and the demands of psychometricians for reliability and validity resulted in a curriculum overweight with content, instruction focused on memorization, and tests that rewarded students able to retain lots and lots of information. The system demanded compliance more than it fostered learning.Several years later, I was invited to join a new public charter school in Massachusetts as principal teacher. The Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School was founded by parents and educators who pioneered an approach to standards and assessment in which each student continuously created original work assembled into a portfolio. Revision was encouraged, and standards were printed on posters hung on the walls of every classroom. Students worked hard to improve their essays, lab reports, and projects until they met the standards, and when they demonstrated to their teachers and classmates through a live exhibition that the standards were met, they were promoted.Those were heady times in Massachusetts. The Education Reform Act of 1993 that enabled charter schools also promised a statewide assessment system to include portfolios and other forms of ‰ÛÏauthentic‰Û assessment like those at the Lab School and the Parker School. But first, under political pressure, regulators were compelled to generate thick manuals of finely parsed learning objectives. Then, the psychometricians went to work figuring out how to measure learning. Shortly, the Department of Education rolled out a battery of on-demand tests, with the grandiose title of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or what we know today more often as the MCAS. No portfolios and nothing authentic about them. Again, compliance ruled the day. Teachers and students would have to fall in line.2001 saw passage of the No Child Left Behind Act. Standards as regulatory tool, in force in some states, became the law of the land. They called it accountability.AdvertisementIn 2006, after 25 years in schools, I reinvented myself as an assistant professor at a nearby university. I wanted to know: Were my experiences part of a larger pattern? I quickly learned two things. The first is that there is a boatload of research showing that accountability has narrowed the curriculum nationwide and turned schools serving our nation‰Ûªs neediest students into test prep factories. And the second is legions of education researchers have seized on the rising tide of test data to answer their questions. The answers are often simplistic in ways that belie the complexity of schools and classrooms, while legitimizing the testing culture.As evidence has mounted that the accountability regime is turning many schools into test prep centers, advocates for accountability have argued that schools need not slavishly teach to the test. Instead, they say, schools should offer a robust curriculum with demanding instruction, and the tests will take care of themselves. This sounds like common sense, but in a study I just completed with Megin Charner-Laird of Salem State University and Stacy Szczesiul of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, we found that schools with reliably high test scores ‰ÛÓ while not teaching to the test per se ‰ÛÓ tend to teach a limited range of skills required for the test. Teachers and administrators told us they would aspire to something more, but this is what the system demands.At schools like the Lab School and the Parker School, demanding standards, attached to assessments that rely on judgment, foster powerful learning. At the system level, strict reliance on measurement, where judgment is expunged as a contaminant, has served to narrow learning and diminish student engagement.The Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA as it is known, holds on to this fundamental element of the accountability movement like a dog does a bone. Meanwhile, a Gallup Student Poll administered last fall shows 68 percent of high school juniors unengaged in school. Portfolios, juried exhibitions, external audits, peer review ‰ÛÓ all of which rely on judgment informed with evidence ‰ÛÓ have been marginalized at the system level, but they are exactly what works at the local level in pushing students to think deeply and engage in learning. Perhaps after ESSA fails to deliver, we will get the message, and a new policy regime will be driven not by the question how do we measure X, but, instead, how do we engage and inspire children and youth?James Nehring is a former Fulbright Scholar and an associate professor of education at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

D.C. Police Will NOT Be Allowed To Have Their Body Cameras On While Monitoring Inaugural Protests,"Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:According to this, D.C. police officers will not be allowed to keep their body cameras on during the inaugural festivities in the nation‰Ûªs capital Friday. They‰Ûªll only be able to turn the cameras on in the event of an escalation that requires police intervention. Some say that poses a problem, as officers won‰Ûªt be able to record what led up to the disruption. Plus, doesn‰Ûªt that kind of defeat the purpose of body cams? Oddly enough, the ACLU fully supports this move, which is incredibly confusing. Wasn‰Ûªt it Democrats who begged for body cameras on police officers? What gives?‰ÛÏWe are concerned what they will do with the data,‰Û Monica Hopkins-Maxwell of the District of Columbia ACLU said.And by that, she means she‰Ûªs afraid that police will catch protesters acting like complete morons. At the same time, the ACLU is demanding that protesters closely monitor the behavior of police officers. They‰Ûªre even promoting an app, Mobile Justice, which allows citizens to report questionable police behavior in real time.‰ÛÏThe more people who are watching, the less incidences of collisions between police and protesters,‰Û Hopkins-Maxwell continued.So let me get this straight. Police shouldn‰Ûªt monitor protesters, but protesters should DEFINITELY monitor police officers. The ACLU only wants recordings of officers misbehaving. Gotta protect the hooligans who are planning on disrupting the day‰Ûªs events, of course.","According to this, D.C. police officers will notåÊbe allowed toåÊkeep their body cameras on during the inaugural festivities in the nation's capital Friday.

"Confirmed: Mainstream Media Guilty of Treason, Crimes Against Humanity---Major Cover-ups Continue! | Alternative","Confirmed: Mainstream Media Guilty of Treason, Crimes Against Humanity‰ÛÓMajor Cover-ups Continue!% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.THE MILLENNIUM REPORT: Reporting the Most Important News in the World Today.MAINSTREAM MEDIA:The True Enemy Of The PeopleMSM Guilty of Multiple Ongoing Cover-upsof Major Government and Corporate Crimes*9/11 VERDICT: Mainstream Media Guilty Of The Biggest Coverup In U.S. History ( VIDEOState of the Nation‰ÛÏEvery major organ of the Mainstream Media hasquite willingly participated in the ongoing cover-upof the Crime of the Millennium‰ÛÓthe 9/11 false flagterror attacks in New York City and Washington.‰Û[1]‰ÛÓ Veteran 9/11 InvestigatorTo many it is now quite obvious that the mainstream media (MSM) is the real enemy of We the People.Stated more accurately it is the owners of the MSM who are the real enemies of the American Republic.Actually, it is those clandestine powers who control the MSM owners, via multiple control mechanisms, who are the true enemies of the American people ‰Û_ as well as the world community of nations.Indisputable Fact: Until this harsh reality is dealt with decisively and firmly,there can be no real change throughout the planetary civilization.Very few are aware, but whoever controls the mainstream media effectively controls the world. That‰Ûªs because whoever controls the flow of information, controls the minds of the global population.Whoever Controls The Media Controls The WorldThe next logical step in this critical research project is to ask:Who REALLY Controls The Mainstream Media?Why is the 9/11 cover-up so important?The highly coordinated cover-up of the U.S. government-directed terror attacks on 9/11 is quite representative of all the major cover-ups throughout modern American history. The true perpetrators utilized the same MO as they did to cover-up the assassination of John of Kennedy ‰Û_ the Oklahoma City Bombing ‰Û_ the Sandy Hook School ‰Û÷massacre‰Ûª, etc. Hence, when one understands how they can successfully cover-up such a massive crime as 9/11, it is then easier to see why they routinely employ the same basic game plan whenever they so choose.9/11 TRUTH GOES NUCLEAR: Massive Download In ProgressFor anyone who has conducted even a modicum of research into the 9/11 black operation, it quickly becomes clear that not only did the U.S. Federal Government coordinate the biggest cover-up in American history, they could only have done so with the full knowledge and support of every major news platform within the MSM.[2]9/11 Commission Report: The Most Ridiculous Conspiracy Theory Of All TimePoint of Fact: Without the intimate involvement of the MSM,the 9/11 cover-up could not have succeeded.TREASON & TRAITORSIn light of the [ONGOING] 9/11 cover-up, it can be stated with absolute certainty that the MSM is guilty of the cover-up of state-sponsored terrorism (by the US government), various crimes against humanity, the countless war crimes of the post 9/11 wars, and high treason of the highest order.9/11 FACT: The Pentagon Was Hit By A Cruise Missile From The US Military ArsenalWhere it concerns the 9/11 false flag operation, the degree of treachery demonstrated by the MSM against the American people is unprecedented in its depth and breadth. Their profound betrayal of the U.S. citizenry through the implementation of the MSM cover-up is both shocking for its sheer audacity as it is stunning for its naked malevolence.What is crucial to understand here is that where the original crime was carried out over 15 years ago, the enormous cover-up continues up to this very day. Therefore, the duration and severity and number of the myriad MSM cover-up crimes grows by the day. As matter of fact, the unprovoked wars of aggression prosecuted by the Obama Administration in the Mideast and elsewhere have only occurred only because of the success of the MSM 9/11 cover-up.War on Terror Justified With 9/11 False Flag Terror AttacksIn view of this irrefutable state of affairs, it can be asserted that those who populate the highest echelons of the entire corporate media are traitors and turncoats. Who they really serve can only be surmised, but their loyalties do not lie with the American Republic. Because the continuing 9/11 cover-up requires so much day-to-day dissemination of known falsehoods and fabricated lies, those who staff the major organs of the MSM at even the lower levels are likewise guilty of treason.There is only one realistic solution to this ever-worsening MSM predicament.The mainstream media in its current form must be shut down and removed from American civil society. Or, it must be completely taken over by a newly constituted U.S. Federal Government that truly serves the interests of the American people, as well as the world-at-large.Any endeavor that is undertaken that does not include one of these two execution plans is essentially worthless. That‰Ûªs because there can be no meaningful dissemination of the truth, or reconciliation throughout the nation, until the power of the press is fully restored to the people themselves. Absent this successful initiative, there can be no justice, nor will there be any peace, at home or abroad. The influence of the American MSM is far too great worldwide and therefore needs to be radically transformed into a force for good.Exactly how the new media platforms are constructed remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the country has seen everything about how NOT to run a media operation, so building a new enterprise based on truth, and run with integrity, ought to be fairly straightforward. It‰Ûªs simply called: ‰ÛÏTell the Truth‰ÛÓAlways!‰ÛConclusionThe current corporate MSM must be shut down and taken over. The sooner the better, as no meaningful change can take place as long as it continues to operate against the interests of the American people.Those individuals who own and operate, direct and oversee, the major corporate media companies need to be arrested post haste for treason and other serious crimes. They should be imprisoned without bail until their trials by jury can be conducted by a special 9/11 Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Within this legal framework and judicial format, they ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.Many media analysts and political commentators in the alternative media have suggested that those who are found guilty ‰ÛÓ of both the 9/11 crimes and cover-up ‰ÛÓ must be given the harshest punishments possible to serve as a powerful deterrent to all future traitors to the American Republic.The Neocon Zionists Must Be Arrested And Put On Trial For False Flag 9/11 TerrorismLet‰Ûªs get busy!State of the NationOctober 3, 2016Source[1] 9/11 VERDICT: Mainstream Media Guilty Of The Biggest Coverup In US History[2] 9/11: The Ultimate Inside Job And False Flag OperationReferences‰Û÷Official‰Ûª NIST Report Shattered by Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth9/11: Russia Presents Evidence Against US, UK And Israel Co-ConspiratorsRecommended ReadingNEOCON CABAL: A Stone-Cold Terrorist Cell Occupies The U.S. Federal Government___MAINSTREAM MEDIA: The True Enemy Of The People | SOTN: Alternative News & Commentary‰ÛÓTHE MILLENNIUM REPORT: Reporting the Most Important News in the World Today.We encourage you to Share our Reports, Analyses, Breaking News and Videos.
