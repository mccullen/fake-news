b'Primary school allows pupils to wear slippers to improve grades',"b""A school in Derbyshire is encouraging its pupils to wear slippers in the classroom to help improve their grades.\n\nFindern Primary School, near Derby, is the latest to adopt the Scandinavian attitude of allowing children to take their shoes off inside.\n\nHeadteacher Emma Titchener suggested the idea to pupils after reading the results of a study that claimed \xe2\x80\x9cshoeless\xe2\x80\x9d children typically showed better behaviour and greater performance in class.\n\nObserving thousands of children from 25 countries of a ten-year period, researchers from the University of Bournemouth found those who left their shoes outside the classroom were more likely to arrive at school earlier, leave later and read more widely.\n\nTrialling the method in one class, teachers at Findern said they saw a significant difference in how students felt and acted in the classroom.\n\nMs Tichener told the Telegraph: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has had a real positive impact; the children are much calmer and more receptive to learning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pupils for more comfortable, they feel more at home and more in tune with the classes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reception among children and teachers has been unanimously positive, and parents are also overwhelmingly supportive of it.\n\nThe world's toughest school run 5 show all The world's toughest school run 1/5 Children carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 2/5 Children carry their schoolbags accompanied by adults climb on a cliff bu using ladder as they on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 3/5 A child carry her schoolbag looks as she takes a rest on a cliff as she and other children on their way back to home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 4/5 A village in China's mountainous west where schoolchildren must climb an 800-meter (2,625-foot)-high bamboo ladder secured to a sheer cliff face may get a set of steel stairs to improve safety Chinatopix/AP 5/5 Schoolchildren carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 1/5 Children carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 2/5 Children carry their schoolbags accompanied by adults climb on a cliff bu using ladder as they on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 3/5 A child carry her schoolbag looks as she takes a rest on a cliff as she and other children on their way back to home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP 4/5 A village in China's mountainous west where schoolchildren must climb an 800-meter (2,625-foot)-high bamboo ladder secured to a sheer cliff face may get a set of steel stairs to improve safety Chinatopix/AP 5/5 Schoolchildren carry their schoolbags climb on a cliff on their way home in Zhaojue county in southwest China's Sichuan province Chinatopix/AP\n\nThe school\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Headteacher, Michelle Hall, said the policy had since been extended across the school and most children and even some members of staff were now choosing to wear slippers over shoes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur pupils are already very well behaved but there have been some changes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is less stomping around and the pupils are a lot calmer and seem very relaxed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe school is believed to be one of the first in the country to introduce the relaxed rules on shoewear, but the approach has long been used by schools in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries where the practice is commonplace.\n\nIn order to conduct their study, researchers from the University of Bournemouth visited schools in New Zealand and Australia, as well as a school in London where the habit had been tested.\n\nExperts found that by removing shoes, classrooms were quieter, providing a calmer atmosphere where pupils were more willing to engage in learning activities.\n\nBullying in schools where the policy had been introduced was also markedly reduced.\n\nIn Scandinavia and other northern European countries, children are asked to leave shoes outside the classroom during bad weather, so as not to bring in slush and snow from outside.\n\nHowever schools in Spain, where it is more common to wear shoes indoors, also tested out the theory and found improved learning and pupil behaviour.\n\nResponding to some criticism of the policy from parents of Findern school pupils, Ms Titchener said: \xe2\x80\x9cLike anything you will always get some opposition to these things, but I think the idea that this makes the children less smartly dressed or less prepared for formal situations is a misconception.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBournemouth University said it hoped more UK schools would take up the change and see results.\n\n""",b'Pupils at Findern Primary School are among the latest to reap benefits from following the Scandinavian practice of leaving shoes at the door',['Rachael Pells'],http://ow.ly,0,0,0.5,1,10,779,23,0,0,0.4,0.160939061,0.3
"b'\xe2\x80\x98UK acting as weapons pimp, reaping rewards of Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s dirty work\xe2\x80\x99'","b""We know Riyadh has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there, and they have also attacked the indigenous of Yemen, the Houthis, Raza Kazim, Islamic Human Rights Commission, told RT.\n\nA cross-party group of British MPs have to decide whether to call for the suspension of UK weapons sales to Saudi Arabia or not. The British Prime Minister Theresa May insists sales should continue, and claims the close ties to the country are necessary to keep British people safe.\n\nRead more\n\nHer comments came after some British MPs called for the UK to halt its weapons sales to the Middle Eastern nation. Members of the Arms Export Controls committee claim that British weapons might have been used in violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nRT: The Prime Minister's comments have now been backed by the Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. Yet reports suggest quite the opposite. Why are Britain's decision makers going against the clear findings?\n\nRaza Kazim: I think we need to look at the plethora of evidence that has been gathered. The Committee itself has said that the UK government is probably in violation of its international human rights obligations due to the way that the weapons that have been supplied by the UK have been used. It is said that the assurances supplied by the Saudi government are also not sufficient, not acceptable and so on. Yet, the UK government continues. We need to understand that basically the UK government is acting like a pimp, and is reaping the benefits of the dirty work that Saudi Arabia is actually doing. This needs to stop.\n\nRT: Saudi Arabia is claiming if the UK suspends arms sales, there might be even higher risks of terrorism spreading. Is that a valid point?\n\nRK: There is no evidence to suggest that. Saudi Arabia is the one that is carrying out acts of terrorism. We know that it has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how Saudi Arabia has attacked Yemen and the indigenous of Yemen, as well, the Houthis, who have been wanting to have self-determination in terms of who is governing them, rather than something that is imposed from Riyadh. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that various organizations, Save the Children, have come out and said that they are not happy with what has been going on. Hospitals, schools and school teachers, head teachers, etc. have been bombed by Saudi Arabia. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the facilities of M\xc3\xa9decins Sans Fronti\xc3\xa8res [(MSF) Doctors Without Borders] hospitals being bombed and verified by MSF.\n\nYet, despite all the evidence that has been gathered in terms of what has been going on, the UK government continues this. We need to be aware that the intelligence offices and people from the UK military establishment are embedded in the command and control center of where these strikes take place. This has been verified in various ways \xe2\x80\x93 by both Saudi Arabia and the UK. We know that this is going on continuously...\n\nNot easy to resist temptation of easy money\n\nDaoud Khairallah, International Law professor at Georgetown University said that it has not been easy for Britain, the US, or other countries that are providing Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons, \xe2\x80\x9cto resist the temptation of money and corruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRT: The Prime Minister's comments have now been backed by the Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. Yet reports suggest quite the opposite. Why are Britain's decision makers going against the clear findings?\n\nDaoud Khairallah: Well, it has not been easy whether for Britain, or the US, or other countries that are providing Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons. It has not been easy to resist the temptation of money and corruption in this sense. The fact is that we have a threat to the international community, to the whole world by terrorism, and the source of support of these terrorist organizations is well-known now. We know the role that Saudi Arabia is playing.\n\nRead more\n\nAdd to this, when Saudi Arabia is involved in military operations, such as in Yemen, crimes of war and crimes against humanities have been committed. And the international community has not been sufficiently diligent to investigate and make accountable those responsible for it. Very few journalist and otherwise have the moral courage of speaking out. In the UK apparently some free minds are expressing concerns and rightly so. This is in response to what the whole human race now is concerned about.\n\nRT: Theresa May rejected calls for the UK to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia and stressed the value of close security co-operation with Riyadh. So do you believe the grounds for such a decision are good enough?\n\nDK: The only explanation is the temptation of providing Saudi Arabia with weapons that are richly paid for by the Saudis. It is very difficult to find another explanation, another reasonable explanation. Humanity is not safer with more violence; it is not safer with encouraging extremist groups that are doing all over the Middle East now and expending throughout the world \xe2\x80\x93 things that are of real concern to the human race and those who still have some moral courage to speak about it.""","b'We know Riyadh has invaded Bahrain to suppress lawful and legal protests that were going on there, and they have also attacked the indigenous of Yemen, the Houthis, Raza Kazim, Islamic Human Rights Commission, told RT.'",[],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,0,12,872,36,1,0,-0.3,0.067535014,0.066666667

"b'Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in Prison'","b'Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in Prison\n\nPhoto Credit: By Miller Center [CC-BY-2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\n\nEver since Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented move to legalize recreational pot last year, excitement and stories of unfettered success have billowed into the air. Colorado\'s marijuana tax revenue far exceeded expectations, bringing a whopping $185 million to the state, and tourists are lining up to taste the budding culture (pun intended). Several other states are now looking to follow suit and legalize.\n\nBut the ramifications of this momentous shift are left unaddressed. When you flick on the TV to a segment about the flowering pot market in Colorado, you\'ll find that the faces of the movement are primarily white and male. Meanwhile, many of the more than 210,000 people who were arrested for marijuana possession in Colorado between 1986 and 2010 according to a report from the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, remain behind bars. Thousands of black men and boys still sit in prisons for possession of the very plant that\'s making those white guys on TV rich.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn many ways the imagery doesn\'t sit right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michelle Alexander, associate professor of law at Ohio State University and author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in a public conversation on March 6 with Asha Bandele of the Drug Policy Alliance. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are white men poised to run big marijuana businesses, dreaming of cashing in big\xe2\x80\x94big money, big businesses selling weed\xe2\x80\x94after 40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed. Now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlexander said she is \xe2\x80\x9cthrilled\xe2\x80\x9d that Colorado and Washington have legalized pot and that Washington D.C. decriminalized possession of small amounts earlier this month. But she said she\xe2\x80\x99s noticed ""warning signs"" of a troubling trend emerging in the pot legalization movement: Whites\xe2\x80\x94men in particular\xe2\x80\x94are the face of the movement, and the emerging pot industry. (A recent In These Times article titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Unbearable Whiteness of Marijuana Legalization,\xe2\x80\x9d summarize this trend.)\n\nAlexander said for 40 years poor communities of color have experienced the wrath of the war on drugs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack men and boys\xe2\x80\x9d have been the target of the war on drugs\xe2\x80\x99 racist policies\xe2\x80\x94stopped, frisked and disturbed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9coften before they\xe2\x80\x99re old enough to vote,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Those youths are arrested most often for nonviolent first offenses that would go ignored in middle-class white neighborhoods.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe arrest these kids at young ages, saddle them with criminal records, throw them in cages, and then release them into a parallel social universe in which the very civil and human rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights movement no longer apply to them for the rest of their lives,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can be discriminated against [when it comes to] employment, housing, access to education, public benefits. They\'re locked into a permanent second-class status for life. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done this in precisely the communities that were most in need of our support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Asha Bandele of DPA pointed out during the conversation, the U.S. has 5% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population and 25% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s prisoners. Today, 2.2 million people are in prison or jail and 7.7 million are under the control of the criminal justice system, with African American boys and men\xe2\x80\x94and now women\xe2\x80\x94making up a disproportionate number of those imprisoned.\n\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s book was published four years ago and spent 75 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, helping to bring mass incarceration to the forefront of the national discussion.\n\nAlexander said over the last four years, as she\xe2\x80\x99s been traveling from state to state speaking to audiences from prisons to universities about her book, she\xe2\x80\x99s witnessed an \xe2\x80\x9cawakening.\xe2\x80\x9d More and more people are talking about mass incarceration, racism and the war on drugs.\n\nOften when people talk about the reasons certain communities are impoverished or lack education they blame the personal choices or moral shortcomings of the people in those communities, but that way of looking at things has got it backwards, she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat these communities are poor and have failing schools and have broken rules is not because of their personal failings but because we\xe2\x80\x99ve declared war on them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve spent billions of dollars building prisons and allowing schools to fail. We\xe2\x80\x99ve decimated these communities by shuttling young people from their underfunded schools to these brand new, high tech prisons. We\xe2\x80\x99ve begun targeting children in these communities at young ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlexander cautioned that drug policy activists need to keep this disparity in mind and cultivate a conversation about repairing the damages done by the systemic racism of the war on drugs, before cashing in on legalization.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter waging a brutal war on poor communities of color, a drug war that has decimated families, spread despair and hopelessness through entire communities, and a war that has fanned the flames of the very violence it was supposedly intended to address and control; after pouring billions of dollars into prisons and allowing schools to fail; we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna simply say, we\xe2\x80\x99re done now?\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have to be willing, as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about legalization, to also start talking about reparations for the war on drugs, how to repair the harm caused.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlexander used the example of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa to point out the way a society can and should own up to its past mistakes. After apartheid ended, the nation passed a law called the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. Under the new law, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed to ""elicit truth"" about the human rights violations that had occurred. The commission recorded the statements of witnesses who endured ""gross human rights violations"" and facilitated public hearings. Those who had committed violence could request amnesty from civil and criminal prosecution in order to share testimony about what they\'d done with the commission.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of apartheid in South Africa there was an understanding that there could be no healing, no progress, no reconciliation without truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t just destroy a people and then say \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s over, we\xe2\x80\x99re stopping now.\xe2\x80\x99 You have to be willing to deal with the truth, deal with the history openly and honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlexander pointed to America\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to shove its racist legacies under the rug rather than own up to them. When the civil war ended, slaves were free on paper but they were left with nothing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cno 40 acres and a mule, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Alexander said. The only option was to work low-paying contract jobs for the same slave owners who had previously brutalized them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after a brief period of reconstruction a new caste system was imposed\xe2\x80\x94Jim Crow\xe2\x80\x94and another extraordinary movement arose and brought the old Jim Crow to its knees,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans said, OK, we\xe2\x80\x99ll stop now. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take down the whites-only signs, we\xe2\x80\x99ll stop doing that. But there were not reparations for slavery, not for Jim Crow, and scarcely an acknowledgement of the harm done except for Martin Luther King Day, one day out of the year. And I feel like, here we go again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLast week, Obama pushed out an initiative called My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper, focused on helping black boys who have fallen down the social ladder.

John Fleming, R-La., had called up on Tuesday. Instead of the vote, the Judiciary panel will hold an impeachment hearing Wednesday where Koskinen will be questioned under oath.\n\nFleming, a Freedom Caucus member, said Thursday the group would ""still reserve the right"" to bring up an impeachment vote, but said it would come after the November election at the earliest.\n\n""To me, this is a huge win for us because there is more information,"" Fleming said. ""We want to get him under oath and explain why he did what he did.

b'Why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work at full capacity',"b'Have you ever felt like you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take time off work because nobody could do your job while you\xe2\x80\x99re away? Do you drop all of your personal plans to work late nights and weekends, and feel guilty simply leaving the office on time?\n\nWork martyrs are drastically changing company culture and leading to a rise in cases of stress and burnout\n\nIf any of the above sounds familiar, then you may be one of the growing number of so-called \xe2\x80\x9cwork martyrs\xe2\x80\x9d who are drastically changing company culture and leading to a rise in cases of stress and burnout.\n\nBinal Patel is the first person to admit he\xe2\x80\x99s a work martyr and that he\xe2\x80\x99s been suffering from mild burnout by sacrificing all of his free time for his career.\n\nThe 25-year old data scientist from Raleigh, North Carolina in the US, says his problems began two years ago when he dove headfirst into a new job at a start-up running analytics for the healthcare industry. There were just 12 employees at the time, and Patel remembers setting the bar a bit too high, working \xe2\x80\x9c12 hours a day at 200%.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe recent university graduate soon realised that taking on masochistic amounts of work was unsustainable\n\nAt first, the positive recognition was addicting, but the recent university graduate soon realised that taking on masochistic amounts of work was unsustainable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver time, your company expects you to work at that initial level because that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done before, and you expect yourself to be at that level because that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting in,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut working that hard all the time just isn\xe2\x80\x99t feasible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPatel found himself becoming less productive and efficient the more hours he put in. He says it took an emotional toll, too, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you expect yourself to be at a higher level.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPatel is not alone in this predicament. According to a new study from The Workforce Institute at Kronos, 81% of salaried employees in the US report that they work outside of their standard work hours, with 29% doing it three or more days per week. A separate study from the US-based Project: Time Off campaign found that millennials, in particular, are much more likely to become work martyrs than their older peers at a rate of 43%, compared with an average of just 29% across all workers.\n\nMillennials are much more likely to become work martyrs than their older peers at a rate of 43%, compared with an average of just 29%\n\nExperts caution that more time in the office doesn\xe2\x80\x99t equate to a better worker, and that bosses need to set clear goals to prevent building potential team burnout into their plans. If not, the repercussions of a stressed-out workforce will become more pronounced as millennials move into management roles and expect the same level of presenteeism from their subordinates.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the future of our work-life balance if this is the mentality we\xe2\x80\x99re fostering,\xe2\x80\x9d says Katie Denis, lead researcher at Project: Time Off. There needs to be a drastic change in attitude among millennials, \xe2\x80\x9cor we\xe2\x80\x99ll see much bigger problems on the horizon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStudies from Marianna Virtanen of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health have linked overworking with numerous stress-related health problems, including depression, impaired sleep and heavy drinking. Meanwhile, a new study of American, Australian and European workers found that those putting in 55 hours or more per week had a 33% greater risk of stroke and 13% greater risk of coronary heart disease when compared with their peers working a standard 40-hour week.\n\nFear and uncertainty\n\nThe current work martyr trend among 18- to 35-year-olds relates to both healthy ego needs (like striving for a sense of accomplishment) and unhealthy levels of anxiety, says Denis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hear this popular narrative that millennials are entitled and spoiled but what we\xe2\x80\x99re finding is that they actually have a lot of fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDenis says many millennials entered the workforce at the height of the recession when jobs were scarce. Not only that, they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with an office culture where technology is ubiquitous, yet its boundaries remain unclear with many feeling chained to their devices.\n\nThe Project: Time Off report found zero correlation between time spent working and career progression\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s very little guidance in the workplace about what\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate [with technology], so it gives us this feeling that we need to be reachable at all times,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis fuels a kind of hyper-intense desire to prove yourself that\xe2\x80\x99s playing out really strongly with millennials.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Project: Time Off report found zero correlation between time spent working and career progression. Quite the contrary, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople reach a maximum threshold,\xe2\x80\x9d Denis explains. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though they may be at the office longer \xe2\x80\x94 or are working longer hours \xe2\x80\x94 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99re producing any more than their peers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA preventable pattern\n\nTy Tucker, CEO of performance management platform REV, says it\xe2\x80\x99s simple to prevent this type of workplace behaviour from occurring in the first place. \xe2\x80\x9cManagement needs to define personal employee goals and identify how people are to be judged around performance,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains.\n\nBosses are often the biggest offenders of work martyrdom\n\nA manager should know what could reasonably be accomplished in a 40-hour week in order to prevent burnout and make appropriate choices about budgeting, staffing and measurable objectives, he says. By working off the clock, particularly when starting out, many employees unwittingly make this task harder on their managers.\n\nTucker believes bosses are often the biggest offenders of work martyrdom. Not only do they set the wrong tone for their employees, but they\xe2\x80\x99re ultimately slowing down the business when they make themselves so indispensable to the company that nothing can happen without them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you create these bastions of isolated knowledge you are ultimately going to be less effective as an organisation,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nMartyrs vs heroes\n\nWhile work martyrs can fall into a toxic trap of long hours and low productivity, Tucker believes there is a healthy alternative: the work hero.\n\nA work hero is usually results driven, not time driven, and may not even be cognisant that he or she is viewed as a hero\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA work hero is someone who can come in, do a great job and save the day when something goes wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Tucker explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThis person is usually results driven, not time driven, and may not even be cognisant that he or she is viewed as a hero.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPatel, the data scientist from Raleigh, is now striving toward the latter. He starts a new job in 2017 and says he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do the exact opposite of what he did when he entered his current company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I start my new role it won\xe2\x80\x99t be about me jumping into everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll still do my job, of course, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it much more of a team-based effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or tweet us on Twitter.'","b'Working too hard is a recipe for burnout.

"b'Transforming the Mundane, Everyday Work of Parenting into A Spiritual Practice'","b'Transforming the Mundane, Everyday Work of Parenting into A Spiritual Practice\n\nThis following is an excerpt from the new book Nurture the Wow: Finding Spirituality in the Frustration, Boredom, Tears, Poop, Desperation, Wonder and Radical Amazement of Parenting by Danya Ruttenberg (Flatiron Books 2016)\n\nJewish law suggests that you should not hold a child during prayer, lest she disturb your concentration, that you should not kiss your children in synagogue, to instill in yourself the idea that no love compares to love of God. If your child is crying, you should indicate\xe2\x80\x94without speaking\xe2\x80\x94to the child to stop crying, and if that doesn\'t work, you should walk away from her so that her crying does not disturb your prayer. Another source reminds fathers not to hold a diapered child before afternoon prayers, lest he become soiled and miss the start of services. All of this leads one Orthodox rabbi I know to remark that, as a result, he doesn\'t pray if he\'s alone with children.\n\nObviously, traditional Jewish law wasn\xe2\x80\x99t written for or by those who are in the trenches of intimate care of small children. There is a not-very-implicit assumption that someone else, somewhere, is in charge of the sticky, huggy, needy, emotional little humans that, evidently, impede a person\'s ability to live a life of spiritual service. Spirituality and children are placed in opposing, incompatible spheres, and women are relegated, along with the children, away from wherever it is that they\'re keeping the spirituality.\n\nThe idea that caring for children could be a core, crucial, even cornerstone aspect of one\'s spiritual and religious life, that loving and caring for them should be integrated, somehow, into one\'s spiritual and religious expression\xe2\x80\x94well, it\'s totally absent from this thinking. And this absence isn\xe2\x80\x99t specific to Judaism. Rather, it\'s the norm, in a lot of corners of the religious world. For example, a friend who is an Episcopal priest admits that ""most of us Christian parents (at least during liturgy) try to shush our children to keep them from \'disturbing\' us or others."" Some churches and synagogues make efforts to be ""family-friendly,"" offering toys in the back corner of the worship space, babysitting, or separate kids\' services in a different room. I both applaud these efforts and make ample use of them, myself. But it\'s true that they continue to perpetuate this notion that grown-up prayer\xe2\x80\x94the ""real"" spiritual life\xe2\x80\x94is something that happens only when the kinder are otherwise occupied. That this kind of intentional spiritual connection cannot happen with children, or as I\xe2\x80\x99d like to suggest, through them.\n\nAcross cultures, more often than not, men have been the authors of authoritative rulings and women have been at home with children. In some places, women were part of, say, a monastic tradition, but generally not mothering at the same time. The reasons for this are usually socio-economic, but at the end of the day, there are a whole set of experiences, issues, questions, and types of thinking that come out of doing the work of parenting that have not been integrated into classical discussions of prayer and religious practice in general.\n\nI wonder how various religious traditions might have formulated their approaches to prayer (and everything else) if they had been thinking about the realities of parenting small children from the beginning. And I wonder what these traditions could look like if the questions, challenges and types of thinking that parenting opens up were taken seriously and brought into the conversation, even at this late date.\n\nSure, one could say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a tension. On the one hand, when people talk about religious disciplines, the implication is that a person has a practice\xe2\x80\x94prayer, meditation, yoga, and so forth\xe2\x80\x94that gets done every day (or three times a week, or whatever), no matter what, and that the practice Does A Thing; it changes you. On the other, well, what parents know better than anybody, is that theories and principles are great, but when living the messy reality of life, they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily serve. And more than that, there might be profound truths to be learned from embracing the flux, the flow, as needed, as appropriate. What if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one way to do this? What if a lot of ways were the right way?\n\nIn my case, I\xe2\x80\x99d been carrying around the ultraviolet light, defining my religious expression by traditional rabbinic yardsticks, certain that it was the only possible option. It had served me well for a long time. But once I became a mother, I became more aware of other manifestations of light and discovered that, though sometimes my old means of spiritual practice still served me, there were other possibilities for connecting to the transcendent that, at times, spoke more deeply to who I had become, what I needed now.\n\nSometimes my prayer\xe2\x80\x94 offered up with intentionality into the great beyond\xe2\x80\x94 involves deep contemplation of my son\xe2\x80\x99s ear, or arm. Sometimes it can be found in just being present with him, in snuggles or smiles or games or fielding questions. Sometimes I manifest it in a tiny cry\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9chelp!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 barely perceptible even to me, when my kids\xe2\x80\x99 needs are too big and overwhelming, when they\xe2\x80\x99re acting out, or even just when they\xe2\x80\x99re being normally spirited and rambunctious despite the fact that Mommy didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep so well last night. Sometimes prayer involves other things\xe2\x80\x94 singing with them, singing words of liturgy to them, saying words of liturgy to God.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that how my prayer life has changed signifies that there\xe2\x80\x99s no wisdom to the tradition; rather, who I am and what I need has changed. Spiritual practice needs to be wide enough to accommodate expansions and contractions, shifts and changes in how we exist in the world. It has to be big enough for all the love we receive and give out. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not kiss your children in synagogue in order to instill in yourself the idea that no love compares to love of God\xe2\x80\x9d? Are you kidding me? Th ere is enough room in our spiritual expressions not only for all of the love, but also for the hectic, distracted chaos that so often defines parenting, if we let it\xe2\x80\x94if we are willing to expand our understanding of how much, how many kinds of, light exists in the world.'","b""While the world's religious texts offer wisdom about love, devotion and sacrifice, they have almost nothing to say about handling the day-to-day challenges raising young kids.

But action flicks aren\xe2\x80\x99t just dominating the silver screen: The television network CW has four superhero shows in its fall line-up, including \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Supergirl,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Arrow\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98DC\xe2\x80\x99s Legends of Tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 while \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98DC Super Hero Girls\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 has its own video series on YouTube.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98The movie industry has a huge impact on costuming, so that\xe2\x80\x99s part of it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Caltagirone said. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98But then again, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a superhero? Halloween is the one day of the year you can get away with it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\nHalloween spending is expected to reach a record $8.4 billion this year, with Americans spending an average of $82.93 on costumes, decorations and candy, up from last year\xe2\x80\x99s $74.34, according to the National Retail Federation.\n\nAbout one third of all Americans plan to buy costumes this year, accounting for $3.1 billion in spending, according to the survey. About 20 percent of children say they will don a superhero custom (versus 6 percent for princesses), while 9.3 percent of millennials are planning to dress as a Batman character such as Cat Woman, Two-Face and the Joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Every year we have the classics: Batman, Superman, Spiderman,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 said Trisha Lombardo, a spokeswoman for the chain Spirit Halloween. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98But this year, we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing a lot of anti-heros, like Harley Quinn, the Joker and Deadpool, who have a mischievous streak.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWith the presidential election looming over Halloween, Lombardi says she expects a steady stream of customers who want to dress up as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. At Total Fright, Caltagirone says he has sold out of several rounds of Trump masks, at $24.95 a pop. On Monday, the day of the first presidential debate, he also sold out of Clinton masks. (Indeed, political costumes ranked third on the list of popular options for adults age 35 and over, behind more traditional witch and pirate get-ups.)\n\nAnother trend this year: Pet costumes. Roughly 16 percent of Americans say they\xe2\x80\x99ll dress up their dogs, cats and bunnies for Halloween, according to the survey. The most popular costumes for pets were pumpkins (1o percent of respondents), followed by hot dogs (8 percent) and bumblebees (5 percent).\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98People are spending more and more money on pet costumes,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Caltagirone said, adding that pet items make up about 20 percent of his sales. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re a part of the family -- and, well, dogs aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to complain about dressing up.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99'",b'This year\xe2\x80\x99s most coveted get-up?

"b'If Pope Francis were right on adultery, the Catholic Church would collapse'","b'OpinionCatholic Church, Faith, Homosexuality, Marriage\n\nDecember 7, 2016 (TheCatholicThing) -- If you approve of bank robbery, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to condemn the act of shoplifting candy bars from a convenience store. I mean, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do this if you are to be logically consistent. If you approve of a greater evil, you can\xe2\x80\x99t logically condemn lesser evils of the same genus.\n\nLikewise, if you approve of murder you cannot, if you wish to retain your reputation for logical consistency, condemn assault and battery.\n\nAgain, if you are a Catholic who approves of adultery, you cannot very well condemn contraception and fornication.\n\nBut in the now famous (perhaps I should say notorious?) Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis seems to approve of what has hitherto been regarded by the Catholic Church as adultery. He asserts \xe2\x80\x93 or at least he certainly seems to assert \xe2\x80\x93 that in certain circumstances a divorced-and-remarried Catholic should be allowed to consider his/her second marriage a true marriage. In other words, this divorced and remarried Catholic should be free to have sinless sexual relations with his/her spouse and should be free to receive Communion.\n\nThis appears to contradict the plain words of Jesus himself, who said (unless the Gospels misreport him) that a married person who marries again while his/her first spouse is living commits adultery. Pope Francis, then, appears to be condoning in certain circumstances what Jesus himself calls adultery. And if the pope does this, how can he then not also condone (in certain circumstances) contraception and fornication?\n\nIn short, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the pope\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of adultery in certain circumstances imply the collapse of almost the entire structure of Catholic sexual morality? Apart from rape and child molestation, what sexual taboos would remain? And won\xe2\x80\x99t the priest or ex-priest who molested boys be able to argue that that kind of thing is allowable \xe2\x80\x9cin certain circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nAs for homosexual sodomy, the question of whether or not to condemn it would depend on whether it is more or less of a sin than adultery. If less, then the pope\xe2\x80\x99s permission of adultery in certain circumstances would also apply to homosexual behavior in certain circumstances. If more, then I suppose Catholics could still condemn homosexual conduct. But in reality, how could they do this if the whole structure of Catholic sexual morality had collapsed? If adultery and fornication deserve approval, who except a genuine homophobe would have the heart to disapprove of homosexual sodomy?\n\nYou could still condemn abortion. For abortion, being homicide, is a worse sin than adultery. In the real world, however, everybody who approves of sexual freedom also approves of adultery. Catholics, beginning with popes and bishops, could still condemn abortion, but their hearts wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in it. De facto, they would approve of it.\n\nA defender of Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia might respond to what I have just said by pointing out that the pope is urging us to tolerate second marriages only in very rare and very narrow circumstances. He does not intend to open the door to the current secular ideal of nearly limitless sexual freedom. True enough. Likewise, the people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t repair the leak in the dike didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to have the dike collapse and the land behind the dike flooded by seawater. After all, it was such a big dike and such a small leak. What harm could be done?\n\nHuman beings, and I include Catholics in that category, are rational animals. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we are infallible; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even mean that we are very smart. But we tend to be consistent, at least in the long run. Once we adopt the principle, for instance, that \xe2\x80\x9call men are created equal,\xe2\x80\x9d it will sooner or later dawn on us that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get rid of slavery. Likewise, once Catholics agree with the pope that Jesus was in error when he expressed his absolutist views about the indissolubility of marriage, the whole structure of Catholic sexual morality will sooner or later collapse.\n\nAnd not just sexual morality. The whole structure of Catholicism will collapse. For if Jesus, who (we should remember) was no minor authority figure in the history of the Church, was wrong about marriage, who knows how many other things he was wrong about? And if Jesus was wrong, it is likely St. Paul and other New Testament writers were wrong. And if Jesus and Paul were wrong, who can be confident in the teachings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church? One small leak in the dike.\n\nClick ""like"" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nNow I don\xe2\x80\x99t write all this as an ultra-conservative. Not at all. If I were able to write the Church\xe2\x80\x99s law regarding marriage and sex, I\xe2\x80\x99d allow everybody at least one divorce; for good people often make big mistakes, especially when young. And I\xe2\x80\x99d have a tolerant attitude toward fornication and unmarried cohabitation, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be only mildly censorious toward an occasional adultery. And if, nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus had asked my advice, I would have recommended that he adopt my views, inspired as they are by the great moral wisdom of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\n\nFor better or worse, however, the Catholic Church is not founded on the wisdom of the very enlightened and progressive present day. It is founded instead on what seems to a truly modern mind to be the provincial \xe2\x80\x9cwisdom\xe2\x80\x9d of an itinerant Palestinian preacher of the first century \xe2\x80\x93 a preacher we Catholics believe to be the all-perfect God incarnate. At least we say we believe this. If we really believe it, and if a disagreement opens up between Jesus and the pope on the question of the indissolubility of marriage, then, much though it grieves us to separate ourselves from such a good man as Pope Francis, we have no choice but to take the side of Jesus in this dispute.\n\nIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t, the dike will collapse.\n\nReprinted with permission from The Catholic Thing.'",b'Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the pope\xe2\x80\x99s blessing of adultery in certain circumstances imply the collapse of almost the entire structure of Catholic sexual morality?',['David Carlin'],http://bit.ly,0,0,0.5,1,12,1004,21,0,0,0.142857143,0.103959481,0.178571429
b'Idaho Planned Parenthood Suing Pro-Life Pregnancy Center Neighbors for Providing Healthcare',"b'Planned Parenthood (PP) has always been a controversial organization and a main target of the pro-life movement. While PP maintains they are vital for women\xe2\x80\x99s healthcare provision in this country, pro-life organizations regularly refute that assertion, saying that the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest abortion provider doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide much care at all; it is certainly not a healthy place for a baby in the womb.\n\nThe fight to publicly defund PP\xe2\x80\x99s abortion mills rages on, but PP also engages in strong-arm tactics and harassment in efforts to shut down alternative forms of women\xe2\x80\x99s and pregnancy healthcare.\n\nNo one knows this better than Brandi Swindell, founder and director of the Stanton Healthcare Center in Boise, Idaho. Swindell is well known in the pro-life movement and established her non-profit, free pregnancy and healthcare center after an experience with a friend who had an abortion changed her heart forever. She saw the pain and emotional despair in the aftermath and knew there had to be a better way to help frightened women in desperate situations.\n\nAfter years of networking and fundraising, Swindell has been able to purchase outright a building to house Stanton services. Those building just so happen to be the direct neighbors of a Planned Parenthood. From the beginning the abortion provider was none too pleased to see the pregnancy center open right next door. They immediately began making petty complaints, even calling police when Swindell sent her assistant to take pictures of surrounding business\xe2\x80\x99s banners as to make sure their own met the size requirements. Their complaint? The assistant stepped on their grass.\n\nThe police took one look at the slight, meek 22-year-old employee and told the Stanton staff to have a nice day.\n\nOver the years Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s PP neighbors have eased up on their complaints. Swindell is extremely careful to meet all of the requirements of the state and her business complex. When Stanton began a mobile healthcare clinic which sometimes parks in the commons area of the complex, it seemed a bridge too far. Last week Planned Parenthood slapped Stanton with a lawsuit alleging misuse and abuse of the common areas and claiming that the clinic invites people to use the common area to protest and cause nuisances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwindell says her attorneys are currently reviewing the rules but are confident PP does not have appropriate grounds for the law suit.\n\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re inviting other groups to our property and they\xe2\x80\x99re blaming us for any nuisances brought by groups. We have very strict policies of code of conduct. Our brand is getting bigger and bigger and women are responding.\n\nThat, claims Swindell, is really what PP finds the most threatening.\n\nWhile PP simply hands out referrals for many vital healthcare services like mammograms and health screenings, the Stanton mobile clinic provides a full array of medical services, free of charge. The 35 ft. state-of-the-art RV includes an exam room, ultrasound equipment, baby supplies, maternity clothes, prenatal vitamins and a host of other medical necessitities for women who are left out of the healthcare system.\n\nFor now the clinic remains local to the center, but once the proper provisions are in place (which Swindell says should be in a short time) the clinic plans to bring their services directly to the homeless community in Boise. They will provide feminine hygiene products and healthcare to homeless women and will continue their support for the refugee community in ID as well. They also aim to travel to high schools and underserved rural areas across the state.\n\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not all Stanton plans to do. After recently closing on their second building Swindell says they have plans to build a \xe2\x80\x9cmega-clinic\xe2\x80\x9d to provide the highest possible quality of life-affirming women\xe2\x80\x99s healthcare. This \xe2\x80\x93 she maintains- is the real reason PP suddenly brought suit. The abortion giant feels threatened. Swindell finds it all very ironic.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is always fighting for access issues; they\xe2\x80\x99re always accusing the pro-life community of trying to block access and here they are trying to block access!\n\nFor Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s part, the healthcare provider claims the only complaints they have ever received from the community in their business complex have come from Planned Parenthood, and in fact they have been welcomed openly as their services have driven up the value of the property.\n\nThey support us. They like us there because we bring some calmness and peace. When Planned Parenthood comes in property value goes down and most businesses don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t like abortion clinics because they kill children but they\xe2\x80\x99re not even wanted by the business community.\n\nSwindell maintains that Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s only goal is to provide quality care for women in need. She wants Stanton to directly compete with PP as an alternative that affirms life instead of takes lives. Stanton\xe2\x80\x99s only tactics are to be visible and accessible. Nothing more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether people are pro-life or prochoice they need to know that Planned Parenthood thinks they have the authority to prevent us from helping women. They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to prevent us from doing good. That\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStanton has set up a GoFundMe page for those who might like to donate in support of their legal defense. There is also information about resources and support opportunities on their website.'","b'While complaining about pro-lifers denying healthcare access, the abortion giant seeks to deny healthcare access'","['Kira Davis', 'Posted At Pm On December', 'Brandon Morse', 'Jennifer Van Laar', 'Alex Parker', 'Amelia Hamilton', 'T Laduke']",http://bit.ly,0,0,0.5,7,11,869,15,0,0,-0.1,0.09168254,0

b'DOJ Warns Landlords About Conducting Criminal Background Checks on Would-Be Renters',"b'The U.S. Justice Department is making it harder for landlords to exclude ex-convicts. (AP File Photo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) - As President Obama commutes the sentences of more and more prisoners, his Justice Department intends to make it harder for landlords to deny affordable housing to ex-convicts.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department announced on Tuesday that it is involving itself in a legal case in New York brought by a group that helps ""formerly incarcerated individuals"" find housing.\n\n\n\nThe group complained that a 917-unit complex in Far Rockaway, Queens (N.Y.) had a policy of refusing to rent to individuals with prior convictions for felonies or misdemeanors other than traffic offenses. The plaintiff argues that this policy has an unjustified disparate impact against prospective African-American and Hispanic tenants, in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Fair Housing Act does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants\xe2\x80\x99 criminal records, the DOJ says \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIn other words, if landlords have policies banning ex-convicts in general, they could be in trouble if too many of those ex-cons happen to be black or ethnic minorities. It\'s called ""disparate impact.""\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis filing demonstrates the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s steadfast commitment to removing discriminatory barriers that prevent formerly incarcerated individuals from restarting their lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Rights Division.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen and men who served their time and paid their debt to society need a place to live, yet unlawful housing policies can too often prevent successful reentry to their communities. While not all criminal records policies adopted by landlords violate the Fair Housing Act, we will take action when they do.""\n\nU.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York said, ""Landlords\' categorical refusals to rent to individuals who have served their debts to society can illegally discriminate against those individuals based on their race or national origin.""\n\n\n\nThere is a growing need for affordable housing for ex-convicts as President Obama frees so many of them.\n\n\n\nAccording to the White House, President Obama has commuted the sentences of 774 inmates, more than the previous 11 presidents combined. With a total of 590 commutations this year, President Obama has now commuted the sentences of more individuals in one year than in any other single year in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\n\nThe Justice Department says when a housing provider\'s background-check policy is found to have a disparate impact, the housing provider must \xe2\x80\x9cprove with evidence -- and not just by invoking generalized concerns about safety -- that the ban is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nEven then, the policy will still violate the Fair Housing Act if there is a less discriminatory alternative.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department intends to ""assist the court"" in determining whether criminal background checks produce unlawful discriminatory effects.'","b'Although the Fair Housing Act does not forbid housing providers from considering applicants\xe2\x80\x99 criminal records, the DOJ says \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical prohibitions that do not consider when the conviction occurred, what the underlying conduct entailed, or what the convicted person has done since then run a substantial risk of having a disparate impact based on race or national origin.""'",['Susan Jones'],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,1,11,495,57,1,0,-0.4,0.100301484,0.15

b'California adopts first U.S. energy-saving rules for computers',"b""LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California regulators on Wednesday adopted the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first mandatory energy efficiency rules for computers and monitors - devices that account for 3 percent of home electric bills and 7 percent of commercial power costs in the state.\n\nApple's new MacBooks are displayed following an Apple event in San Francisco, California March 9, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo\n\nThe state Energy Commission said that when fully implemented the industry-backed plan will save consumers $373 million a year and conserve at least as much electricity annually as it takes to power all of San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s households.\n\nFinal approval at a meeting of the five-member commission in Sacramento capped several years spent developing the rules in collaboration with computer makers, consumer activists, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and other environmental groups.\n\nThe new rules will cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion to generate power by 700,000 tons a year, the NRDC said.\n\nThe standards work by setting benchmarks for machines\xe2\x80\x99 overall energy use - focusing on when they are turned on but left inactive - and leave manufacturers flexibility to choose which efficiency measures are employed to meet the standards, an approach aimed at fostering innovation.\n\nThe rules drew support from nearly 40 companies represented by the Information Technology Industry Council, including such Silicon Valley giants as HP Inc and Intel Corp.\n\nHP environmental compliance manager Paul Ford called the standards \xe2\x80\x9cgroundbreaking,\xe2\x80\x9d describing them as \xe2\x80\x9cambitious but achievable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a big deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Cooper, a policy analyst for the Consumer Federation of America, adding that computer ownership per capita in California ranks second in the world behind Sweden.\n\nIn California, computers and monitors draw an estimated 5,610 gigawatt-hours of energy per year - representing roughly 3 percent of residential electric bills and 7 percent of power costs for commercial users - much of that while the devices sit idle.\n\nThe NRDC has said the amount of power consumed by computers and monitors will be reduced by a third once there is a complete turnover in existing stocks of those devices.\n\nThe first phase of the rules takes effect in January 2019 for desktop, laptop and notebook computers. The standards kick in for workstations and small-scale servers in January 2018 and for computer monitors in July 2019.\n\nVideo-game consoles, industrial computers, large-scale servers, tablets and other handheld devices are exempt.\n\nThe standards will add about $14 to average retail costs of desktops, which are far less energy efficient than laptops, but will save consumers more than $40 in electric bills over five years, according to commission estimates.\n\nOver half of desktops typically in use in California now meet the first tier of the standards, which grow more stringent in 2021. Seventy-three percent of laptops already comply.\n\nComputer monitors have farther to go, with a compliance rate of just 14 percent among the 25 million units now installed in homes and businesses statewide.\n\nThe latest rules could set a new standard for manufacturers everywhere by virtue of the size of the consumer market in California, which often leads the way in U.S. environmental initiatives.\n\nIf the same standards are adopted nationwide, they could save U.S. consumers about $2.2 billion annually in electric bills while reducing energy generation by the equivalent output of seven coal-fired power plants, the NRDC said.\n\nReporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Jonathan Oatis""","b""California regulators on Wednesday adopted the nation's first mandatory energy efficiency rules for computers and monitors - devices that account for 3 percent of home electric bills and 7 percent of commercial power costs in the state.""",['Steve Gorman'],http://reut.rs,0,0,0.5,1,8,563,37,1,0,0.25,0.048951049,0.125
b'Opinion | The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes',"b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe inequities contribute to the great American stagnation that I described in last week\xe2\x80\x99s column. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by G.E., Coca-Cola and others is money that can\xe2\x80\x99t be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can\xe2\x80\x99t be used to reduce their taxes and can\xe2\x80\x99t pay for schools, medical research or clean energy.\n\nThere is another victim, too \xe2\x80\x94 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.\n\nBrick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\xe2\x80\x99t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\xe2\x80\x99t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\xe2\x80\x99t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s rate.\n\nThis system is cumbersome \xe2\x80\x94 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \xe2\x80\x94 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\xe2\x80\x99 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.\n\nFortunately, there are signs of hope. Overhauling the corporate tax code is a rare issue on which the two parties have some common ground. If the Democrats take the Senate, Wyden is in line to lead the Finance Committee and says its first priority will be a big bill to improve roads, bridges and public transit systems (and create jobs). The second will be a corporate-tax bill to pay for the infrastructure. Both are good ideas.'","b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to stop companies \xe2\x80\x94 like Amazon, Boeing and Coca-Cola \xe2\x80\x94 from damaging the economy by legally shirking taxes.'",[],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,0,8,318,20,0,0,0,0.204453024,0.2

Only 2 percent said relations would further deteriorate and 27 percent said they expected no major changes.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of respondents hold that the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 choice of president also affects the lives of Russians, while 16 percent think this is not the case.\n\nRead more\n\nIn February last year, the negative attitude towards the US and EU among the Russian public was the highest in modern history, with 36 percent wanting their country to further distance itself from the West.

And did you know that Oklahoma absolutely shattered their yearly record for earthquakes in 2015 and may break it again this year?\n\nAccording to the USGS, the number of significant earthquakes in the eastern and central sections of the nation has more than quintupled in recent years, and concern is growing that we could soon see a \xe2\x80\x9cmegaquake\xe2\x80\x9d in the middle part of the country. Of course no discussion of megaquakes in the middle part of the country can leave out the New Madrid fault zone, which is approximately six times larger than the San Andreas fault zone in California. Scientists assure us that the New Madrid fault is around 30 years overdue for a major seismic event, and when it does happen it is going to be the biggest disaster in modern American history up to this point. Late last month, eight states took part in a major drill that simulated what the damage from a New Madrid earthquake might look like. \xe2\x80\x94Prophecy News Watch\n\nFEATURE VIDEO\n\nConcerns Grow About Coming New Madrid Megaquake As Blood Saturates Entire Town\n\nThe following comes from a news report that was posted on August 24th:\n\nEight states are taking part in a multi-state disaster drill Wednesday.

"b'For your retirement planning, count on living until age 95'","b'CLOSE According to a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 65.4% of American families with heads of household 55 and older held debt in 2013. USA TODAY\n\nPlanning for how long your nest egg needs to last is a difficult one. (Photo: Thinkstock)\n\nIf you knew your date of death, retirement planning would be a breeze.\n\nUnfortunately \xe2\x80\x94 or maybe fortunately? \xe2\x80\x94 you don\'t. And that can make planning for retirement extremely difficult. Does your nest egg need to last 20 years? 30 years? 40 years? And what about couples? How should couples go about planning for the likelihood that one spouse \xe2\x80\x94 usually the husband \xe2\x80\x94 predeceases the other?\n\nWell, if you\xe2\x80\x99re like most people, you\xe2\x80\x99re guessing at this, and guessing quite wrong.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany people do not understand longevity well, and those people who plan often do not plan for long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d says Anna Rappaport, president of a retirement consulting firm bearing her name and chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks.\n\nNoel Abkemeier is the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. (Photo: Handout)\n\nBecoming familiar with current life-expectancy statistics is the first order of business. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two aspects to addressing longevity,\xe2\x80\x9d says Noel Abkemeier, the founder of Abkemeier Actuarial and chair of the American Academy of Actuaries Lifetime Income Task Force. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, understanding it, and then planning an income that will last throughout life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou may live much longer than you think. ""There have been significant improvements in how long people survive in retirement, especially for wealthier Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management.\n\nConsider: Someone born in 1950 was expected to live to age 68.2. By contrast, someone born in 2014 was expected to live to age 78.8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In other words, someone born today will need to fund an extra 10 years of retirement vs. someone born 66 years ago.\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s more, life expectancy for those alive at age 65 has also increased dramatically. In 1950, a 65-year-old male could expect to live another 12.8 years. In 2014, a 65-year-old male could expect to live on average of 18 more years. The same is true for women. In 1950, a 65-year-o woman could expect to live another 15 years. By 2014, a 65-year-old woman could expect to live another 20.5 years.\n\nThe Actuaries Longevity Illustrator can give you a good sense of how long you might live. Another resource is the Living to 100 life expectancy calculator.\n\nFinancial advisers are starting to change assumptions about how long clients will live to make sure they don\'t outlive savings, according to a survey by InvestmentNews. Advisers are basing retirement-income plans on an average life span of 91 for men and 94 for women, according to the survey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany people do not understand longevity well,\xe2\x80\x9d says Anna Rappaport, chair of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Committee on Post-Retirement Needs and Risks. (Photo: Anna Rappaport Consulting)\n\nConsider the probabilities. One drawback with using life expectancy to plan for retirement is that it\xe2\x80\x99s just an average. One-half will die before life expectancy, and the other half after. So, the better way to approach the problem is to consider the probability of living to certain ages.\n\nConsider: There\xe2\x80\x99s a 25% chance that a 65-year-old man will live to 93; a 25% chance that a 65-year-old woman will live to 96; and for a couple 65 years old, there\xe2\x80\x99s a 25% chance that the surviving spouse lives to 98, according to SOA projections.\n\nAll that said, Blanchett still thinks it makes more sense for people (and planners) to use a fixed time horizon, such as planning to age 95.\n\nCouples should consider their combined planning timeline. For couples who are 65 today, there\xe2\x80\x99s a 45% chance that a wife outlives her husband by five years and a 20% chance by 15 years, according to the SOA. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that assets need to last until the second to die for couples,\xe2\x80\x9d says Rappaport.\n\nConsider your genes and behavior. \xe2\x80\x9cSome factors that influence how long you live may be beyond your control,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the SOA. \xe2\x80\x9cOthers depend upon the choices you make every day. A successful retirement plan will address both.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHow will you manage longevity risk? There are some time-honored ways to deal with the risk of outliving your assets. Those include the use of annuities, a sound asset-drawdown plan, delaying Social Security to age 70 for the higher wage earner, and a reverse mortgage. Read Managing Post-Retirement Risks - A Guide to Retirement Planning.\n\nRemember, says Abkemeier, half of retirees will live longer (than life expectancy) and, to build in a cushion, individuals should plan for an additional five or more years when considering lifetime income.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

b'Katy Waldman\xe2\x80\x99s 10 Favorite Books of 2016',"b'Photo illustration by Slate. Images by Amazon\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTraister was an indispensable voice during the 2016 election, writing about Hillary Clinton with warmth, lucidity, and insight. All three qualities are on display in her extraordinarily researched, cogently argued investigation into the rise of the single woman, which examines how unmarried women have long spearheaded social change and tracks the uneven line from past progressive movements to our current feminist flourishing. (I only wish she could have included a post-Trump addendum.) Especially notable is Traister\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the full racial and economic spectrum of womanhood and to the oft-underrated bonds of female friendship.\n\nHeat and Light by Jennifer Haigh. Ecco.\n\nIn this sensitive and sweeping novel, Haigh returns to the fictional Bakerton, a mining village overtaken by \xe2\x80\x9cfracking frenzy\xe2\x80\x9d in the late 2010s. The locals are divided over whether to lease their land to an unscrupulous energy company; transient drillers flood into the bars with their lusts and sorrows; activists descend; salesmen make bargains with the townsfolk, the devil, and themselves. By the end of the book\xe2\x80\x99s 430 pages, Haigh\xe2\x80\x99s patient, cumulative arguments (about greed, faith, chance, and community) have achieved real sonority, and we feel fully invested in her individual characters. Heat and Light is that rare \xe2\x80\x9cambitious social novel\xe2\x80\x9d whose interlocking pieces are as vividly and precisely realized as its panoramic themes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nModern Lovers by Emma Straub. Riverhead.\n\nRead Slate\xe2\x80\x99s review.\n\nAs she demonstrated with her witty The Vacationers, Straub has charm to spare. In Modern Lovers, an ensemble novel about more-or-less forlorn fortysomethings in twee Brooklyn, her trademark nimbleness serves a story of startling emotional depth. Straub\xe2\x80\x99s adult characters (some of whom played together in a punk band) can\xe2\x80\x99t quite relinquish the dream of youth; their children don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to grow up, either. Disruptions small and large break across their interconnected paths, and there is deep satisfaction in watching an author as psychologically astute and empathetic as Straub play out their various responses. But the purest joys of the novel come from rooting for these relatably rudderless people as they attempt to sail into maturity with a modicum of grace.\n\nMoonglow by Michael Chabon. Harper.\n\nRead Slate\xe2\x80\x99s review.\n\nAgain, you may be shocked\xe2\x80\x94shocked!\xe2\x80\x94to learn that the latest novel from Pulitzer Prize\xe2\x80\x93winning author Chabon, a shimmering \xe2\x80\x9cmemoir\xe2\x80\x9d about his grandparents, is among the year\xe2\x80\x99s best. But the pleasure of surrendering to Chabon\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable skills as a storyteller can\xe2\x80\x99t be overstated. He excels on every level: his gorgeous, funny, looping sentences; his knack for the harlequin escapade; his deft swerves into emotional honesty and power; his intuitive mastery of suspense, tension, and release. Plus, American hero Ramon the cat deserves all the accolades for his third-act moment of bravery. Go Ramon!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMy Name Is Lucy Barton by Elizabeth Strout. Random House.\n\nIn Strout\xe2\x80\x99s deceptively quiet hands, a line of dialogue can seem simple or commonplace until it begins to burn, a glowing coal plucked from the furnace of some character\xe2\x80\x99s psyche. My Name Is Lucy Barton is a masterpiece of slow-dawning meaning, an interrogation of family relationships that takes as its occasion an older woman\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the bedside of her convalescent daughter. (And that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say about the plot!)\n\nNight of the Animals by Bill Broun. Ecco.\n\nIn the England of 2052, an authoritarian king lords over a broken, drug-addled society, while the internet plays directly on people\xe2\x80\x99s corneas and suicide cultists seek salvation in the murder of animals. Homeless, nonagenarian addict Cuthbert believes he can save the world by releasing the creatures in the London Zoo, a task that plunges him deep into Celtic myth, the intrigues of the dystopian police state, and the scattered phantasms of his buried past. Broun\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBrexit novel,\xe2\x80\x9d acquiring new resonance under the sign of Trump, is an eerie, wildly original debut\xe2\x80\x94a blur of beauty and madness, like van Gogh\xe2\x80\x99s Starry Night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis novel\xe2\x80\x94about an academic malcontent; his accidentally revolutionary mother; and the constellation of students, family members, blowhard politicians, reactionary cops, video game addicts, ghosts, and Norwegian hobgoblins encircling them\xe2\x80\x94is a Thanksgiving banquet of a book, a narrative table groaning with dishes both delicious and overdone. Hill, a gifted satirist whose lambasting of special-snowflake millennials and escapist gamer nerds can feel too broad, slips in tone from intelligent and realist to zanily experimental to lush and dreamy. His 600-page opus is an extravaganza of talent, a beautiful and idiosyncratic mess that for all its flashiness finds its most expressive voice when exploring basic human themes: love, anger, loneliness, regret.\n\nIn Winters\xe2\x80\x99 speculative portrait of present-day America, slavery persists in four states (the \xe2\x80\x9cHard Four\xe2\x80\x9d), and hypercompetent government agents track down fugitives with the amoral aplomb of James Bond. One such operative is Victor, a freed slave whose nightmarish past keeps erupting into his detective work. The book is profligate with its noir tropes, funny, gripping, imaginative, and inexorable as it gradually unmasks the unthinkable evil at its core. The storyline, in other words, doubles as a descent\xe2\x80\x94and there is always further down to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhitehead, who won this year\xe2\x80\x99s National Book Award for fiction, isn\xe2\x80\x99t hurting for laurels\xe2\x80\x94and yet it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine drafting a list of 2016\xe2\x80\x99s mightiest books without including this phantasmagorical slash into the dark gut of American racism. Cora, an escaped slave, travels through the South on a literal subterranean train, each stop an object lesson in a different ghoulish facet of white supremacy. Her resolve and dignity are moving\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s the author\xe2\x80\x99s playfulness and unpredictability that elevate this traditional tale of hardship into something singular, fugitive, and strange.\n\nThis memoir, from a literary-minded neurosurgeon who is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer in his 30s, is poetic and generous, intimate and profound. In clear and flowing prose, Kalanithi describes his self-formation as a doctor and then the evaporation of that identity as he becomes, again, a patient, starving for time. If some sections of the book are rougher or more abstract than others, the overall work recalls a world of almost pre-Christian luminousness, in which classical concepts like virtue, honor, and excellence still have purchase, chance or fate reigns supreme, and no person can evade the dark forever.\n\n---\n\nHeat and Light: A Novel Check out this great listen on Audible.com.

b'Why Glenn Beck Really Hates Steve Bannon',"b""There has been something delightfully ironic about watching Glenn Beck become one of the sanest voices in conservative media over this past year.\n\nThe Texas-based right-wing radio host and founder of The Blaze website\xe2\x80\x94who once declared that Barack Obama has a \xe2\x80\x9cdeep-seated hatred for white people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was #NeverTrump from the beginning of the GOP primaries. He initially threw his weight behind Ted Cruz and didn\xe2\x80\x99t budge from his anti-Trump stance even after Cruz decided to endorse the man who insulted his wife and blamed his father for the JFK assassination.\n\nAs Election Day approached, Beck openly toyed with the idea of voting for Hillary Clinton, criticized Trump during the third presidential debate for his baffling incoherence on abortion, and called FBI Director James Comey \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsible\xe2\x80\x9d for tossing an October grenade into the race at the last minute.\n\nThroughout the race, however, Beck has reserved his harshest words for Steve Bannon, who just this weekend was named President-elect Trump\xe2\x80\x99s chief strategist. But is Beck\xe2\x80\x99s great moral outrage over the self-proclaimed leader of the alt-right as selfless as it seems? Or is it personal?\n\nIt was all the way back in February of this year, when Cruz still had a chance and months before Trump had hired Bannon to serve as his campaign CEO, that Beck launched his attack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that I believe that Bannon thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s either going to be the chief of staff or he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the next Roger Ailes,\xe2\x80\x9d Beck said, presciently. He accused the Breitbart executive chairman of \xe2\x80\x9ctaking orders from a political candidate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creworking your entire site to promote the lies of a specific candidate without any kind of truth behind these things.\xe2\x80\x9d In Beck\xe2\x80\x99s view, that made Bannon more like Joseph Goebbels than Ailes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew Breitbart would be spinning in his grave right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Beck said, referring to the late founder of Breitbart.com.\n\nBut as it turns out, neither Breitbart nor Bannon were big fans of Beck, who launched The Blaze as a direct competitor to Breitbart after he was let go by Ailes and Fox News.\n\nA few months after Beck started broadcasting his GBTV show online in 2011, Andrew Breitbart went on Steve Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cVictory Sessions\xe2\x80\x9d podcast, and the two men spent a good deal of time trashing their new competition.\n\nBeck had made some provocative comments comparing Newt Gingrich to Barack Obama and suggested Tea Partiers only liked Gingrich because he was white, and Breitbart and Bannon accused Beck of \xe2\x80\x9crace-baiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the past, Beck has made a lot of mistakes, and his supporters come out and try to defend him, because Beck is a coward and will not defend himself when he makes a mistake or lies about a person or steals content,\xe2\x80\x9d Breitbart said.\n\nEgging him on, Bannon replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHold on, I want to go back over this: You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Glenn Beck\xe2\x80\x99s a coward, Glenn Beck\xe2\x80\x99s a liar, and you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Glenn Beck steals material from people?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, and this is well-documented,\xe2\x80\x9d Breitbart said, laying out what he viewed as Beck\xe2\x80\x99s deliberately misleading coverage of the Shirley Sherrod scandal, which began its life on Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s Big Government website. He went on to say that Beck has been known to \xe2\x80\x9ctake countless bloggers\xe2\x80\x99 content, to turn it into book gold, to turn it into chalkboard gold, his infamous chalkboards,\xe2\x80\x9d an allegation explored in detail by The Daily Caller\xe2\x80\x99s Matthew Boyle earlier that year.\n\nAsked by Bannon what he would like to see Beck do next, Breitbart said, \xe2\x80\x9cAt this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what he does because he\xe2\x80\x99s dead to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFive years later, Bannon had officially joined the Trump campaign and Beck was openly calling him \xe2\x80\x9cquite possibly the most dangerous guy in all of American politics\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9chorrible, despicable human being.\xe2\x80\x9d His assertion that Bannon uses the \xe2\x80\x9cDark Web\xe2\x80\x9d to exact revenge on his enemies landed Beck on Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s list of the \xe2\x80\x9c six dumbest claims \xe2\x80\x9d journalists made about Bannon.\n\nAfter news broke that Bannon would be joining Trump in the White House, Beck once again warned against Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cclear tie to white nationalists,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a terrifying man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese sentiments were echoed on Monday by Dana Loesch, who sued Breitbart\xe2\x80\x94citing an \xe2\x80\x9cincreasingly hostile\xe2\x80\x9d work environment\xe2\x80\x94before joining The Blaze, during her live show. \xe2\x80\x9cSteve Bannon puts himself above everything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of her former boss. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is a good fit for the country. Maybe it is for Steve Bannon, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good fit for the country.\xe2\x80\x9d Loesch suggested that Bannon will enter the White House with \xe2\x80\x9cvengeance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpettiness\xe2\x80\x9d in his heart, which should alone \xe2\x80\x9cdisqualify\xe2\x80\x9d him from advising the president.\n\nWhen Beck first joked that Bannon was angling to be Trump\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff earlier this year, he had no idea how right he would end up being. That job may have ended up going to Reince Priebus, but it was Bannon who got top billing on the official press release. In the end, Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions far exceeded being the next Roger Ailes.\n\nNow, a man who has never hid his disgust for Beck is about to become arguably the second most powerful person in Washington, if not the country. And at the same time, Trump and his team have made every indication that they intend to act hostilely toward a \xe2\x80\x9crigged\xe2\x80\x9d media that they believe has been biased against them from the beginning.\n\nIt is yet another irony that Beck now finds himself in their crosshairs along with the rest of us.""",b'The Blaze founder has become an unlikely voice of reason on the right.

"b""BREAKING: Top Trump Adviser Drops Bombshell... Wednesday Is the END of Hillary's Campaign""","b'One of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s top surrogates made news when he intimated that a WikiLeaks release of information on Hillary Clinton, which he says will happen Wednesday, could finish her campaign.\n\nIn a Twitter posting this weekend, Trump adviser and Republican political consultant Roger Stone said that the information, which he says will be released Wednesday, will somehow end Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday @Hillary Clinton is done. #Wikileaks,\xe2\x80\x9d Stone tweeted.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RogerJStoneJr/status/782443074874138624 ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nThe information was originally scheduled to be released Tuesday, but NBC News (via Heat Street) reported WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange ordered the release pushed back due to \xe2\x80\x9csecurity concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTRENDING: How Trump Brilliantly Screwed Over Red State Dem Senators with Kavanaugh Nomination\n\nThose security concerns are hardly illusory, especially when one is dealing with the left. Back in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a huge trove of classified diplomatic cables that embarrassed the Obama administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, liberal commentator Bob Beckel recommended that Assange be assassinated, suggesting during a Fox News television appearance that someone \xe2\x80\x9cshoot the son of a bitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAssange also intimated after his organization\xe2\x80\x99s leak of Democratic National Committee documents that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich had been one of the organization\xe2\x80\x99s sources. According to The Hill, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped the organization, which has said it plans to release more information on Clinton before the Nov. 8 election.\n\nIt is unknown whether the delayed information will actually be released on Wednesday, but Stone seems to believe, from his tweet, that it will be.\n\nWikiLeaks\xe2\x80\x99 most significant information dump on the Democrats, which occurred right before the Democratic National Convention in July, confirmed that the party organization was operating as a de facto arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign and was actively working to undermine the insurgent campaign of socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe emails also exposed coordination between the DNC and the media.\n\nHow much more damaging are these emails than those that WikiLeaks has already released? If Roger Stone is right, this could be the biggest information dump in the organization\xe2\x80\x99s history.

In some ways, I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be more interesting than the first. (I actually found the first debate a bit\xe2\x80\xa6underwhelming.)\n\nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s all warmed up. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s taken the advice of his critics and advisors. I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting him to REALLY show up tonight. I assumed he\xe2\x80\x99d have a stronger debate performance the second time around anyway. But with all of the news that broke over the last few days\xe2\x80\x93 Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decade-old lewd comments and WikiLeaks\xe2\x80\x99 document dump, revealing the content of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s top secret Wall Street speeches\xe2\x80\x93 this debate should be even more interesting.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d love to see Trump\xe2\x80\x99s debate strategy for tonight. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lie. I\xe2\x80\x99m nervous. I kinda want to approve it beforehand. (Another reason I love Pence so much. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get nervous every time he opens his mouth.) Trump kept it pretty classy last time but had some serious missed opportunities. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t hammer Hillary on the Clinton Foundation at all. He gets too caught up in defending every little detail of his life, and people aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in that. That\xe2\x80\x99s why moderators pose questions the way they do. They know Trump will go down rabbit trails.\n\nThe biggest question today? Will Trump \xe2\x80\x9cgo there.\xe2\x80\x9d You know what I mean. Will he bring up Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s infidelity and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s role as his enabler? I mean, if she\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring up the remarks Trump made about women 10+ years ago, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair game, right?\n\nIt looks like that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan.\n\nTrump source on debate strategy: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as much an attacker of women as Bill.

He showed restraint. But if Hillary tries to bring up the stupid Trump Tapes, I say it\xe2\x80\x99s fair game.\n\nSo what about Hillary? Is she prepared to deal with it?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the release of the video I would have suggested hitting back pretty hard, but now I don\xe2\x80\x99t she needs to do so cause it is so disturbing,\xe2\x80\x9d Democratic strategist Jim Manley said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe needs a clever way to deflect and let him continue to dig his own grave, because if he goes down that path he is just going to turn voters off,\xe2\x80\x9d Manley added.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of.

"b'WATCH: Punk Tries to Ruin Concert for Vets, So Luke Bryan PUNCHES Him From Stage'","b""Country singer Luke Bryan performed at Nashville\xe2\x80\x99s Bridgestone Arena Wednesday as part of Charlie Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s 80th birthday all-star Volunteer Jam \xe2\x80\x94 a concert that raised money for military veterans, Taste of Country reported.\n\nSadly, one concert-goer decided to make an obscene gesture, and Bryan didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it sitting down \xe2\x80\x94 he punched the man from the stage.\n\nIn the middle of a song, a man in the front row decided to give Bryan the middle finger. Bryan reportedly yelled \xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d before he went ahead and punched the man, according to Us Weekly. Bryan then gathered himself and went on with his performance.\n\nTake a look at a video of the altercation below both on Twitter and an up-close version posted to YouTube:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_kelseymeador/status/804188938265042944 ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nAfter the altercation, Rolling Stone posted a statement from Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s team:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man in (the) front row was making crude hand gestures toward Luke during his performance. It was insulting not only to him, but more importantly to the men, women and families sitting around him who were there to support and celebrate Charlie Daniels and the efforts of raising money for the military veterans \xe2\x80\x94 some of who were in the audience. The concert security personnel saw the man\xe2\x80\x99s disruptive actions of the event and he was escorted out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe obscene gesture was apparently the tip of the iceberg, according to Rolling Stone, which reported that there were two hecklers in the crowd, one with an insulting sign that referenced Bryan\xe2\x80\x99s famous tight jeans.\n\nAlthough it\xe2\x80\x99s not a great idea to punch a guy in the front row \xe2\x80\x94 if only for your own safety \xe2\x80\x94 it is understandable why Bryan did it. The event was meant to raise money for vets and the man\xe2\x80\x99s actions were extremely disrespectful.\n\nFortunately, as Taste of Country reported, the man was escorted out by security and the event wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hampered \xe2\x80\x94 $240,000 was raised that night for the Journey Home Project which works to help veteran\xe2\x80\x99s lives in a variety of ways.\n\nTo behave like that person did is unacceptable \xe2\x80\x94 especially at an event to raise money for veterans. There\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for it, and while Bryan probably should have kept his cool, sometimes people reap what the sow.\n\nTRENDING: ABC News Lambasted After Posting Incredibly Biased Statement on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s SCOTUS Nominee\n\nH/T Independent Journal Review\n\nPlease share this post on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.\n\nWhat's your take on what Bryan did?

If you\xe2\x80\x99re a standup comic and you can\xe2\x80\x99t take occasional taunts and heckling, you\xe2\x80\x99re in the wrong business. I had a drunk charge the stage one time. The bouncer caught him, and I stood there blowing kisses at him while the bouncer dragged him out and the crowd laughed like hell. Don\xe2\x80\x99t play organized hockey, even at the college or social club level if you can\xe2\x80\x99t take boos and nasty comments from the stands.

Trumps\xe2\x80\x99 wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier today made my skin crawl. I come from a military family. My father was a veteran, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop sobbing when they gave me the flag that draped his casket at Lincoln National cemetery. I have an uncle who died in a jeep accident in Germany on active duty, and a great uncle who lies at rest somewhere in the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his name on the wall of the memorial. I lost two close friends who were coworkers in Afghanistan, I attended both of the funerals. Even though I\xe2\x80\x99ll be 60 next month, I still carry my Vietnam era draft card in my wallet. This is personal to me.\n\nIt turned my stomach to watch that fat, arrogant orange penguin, who has sacrificed nothing and no one in his life, and who has so little respect for our brave troops that he referred to his swinging lifestyle in New York in the \xe2\x80\x9870s as his own personal Vietnam, even though he received phony deferments to keep from going to Vietnam, wrapping his tiny fingers around that wreath and placing it in front of the tomb of brave, anonymous men who sacrificed everything so that he could grab women by the crotch with impunity. But what really made my blood boil was when a commentator said that the next time he does that at Arlington, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be saluting instead of putting his hand over his heart! Needless to say, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be watching any of those future ceremonies for the next four years.\n\nYou all know that I have dug into Mein Furor pretty extensively for the last almost 20 months, and usually I just roll with the punches, by trying to heap scorn and sarcasm about everything he says or does. There is so much to hate about him that this website would have to expand to take the diaries if they were all to be chronicled. But these next four years are going to be rough for me, watching him pudge waddle down the steps of Marine One and throwing a salute to the guard soldier at the bottom of the steps, a man who would fight and die for him if Trump ordered it, and a man that Donald J. Trump couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit less about.\n\nSorry for the rant, but this has been eating at me for almost three hours now, and I just had to get it out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll write about tomorrow, I had thought about not even turning on the t.v., but somehow I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I will, for no better reason than to find something to mock.

Yet \xe2\x80\x9cso far most of the displaced families leaving Mosul have been able to access some form of assistance from Oxfam and from others [humanitarian organizations].""\n\nRead more\n\nThe Oxfam press officer also noted that it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial for all sides to avoid using heavy weaponry inside the city since it puts civilian lives at risk.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very worrying when there is a conflict that close to where the people are living and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in other places and in Mosul so far, the way ISIS seem willing to use people as human shields,\xe2\x80\x9d Tabacek warned.\n\n\n\nHe also said that liberating Mosul won\xe2\x80\x99t automatically eliminate the humanitarian crisis in the area: \xe2\x80\x9cMore than 3 million people that are displaced in northern Iraq. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not only from Mosul, that\'s a number of other areas that have been recaptured in the last few years. This is a crisis that is not going to go away anytime soon,\xe2\x80\x9d Tabacek said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the operation to retake Mosul has slowed down in the past weeks since the Iraqi army and militias are going deeper into the city. In addition, an early December report by Debkafiles, a military intelligence news site with links to the Israeli military, said Islamic State is now mulling to stay put in their Iraqi stronghold. According to the report, a delegation of IS commanders arrived in Mosul on December 4, to discuss synchronizing the city defenses with those of Raqqa in Syria. Mosul commanders have \xe2\x80\x9cchanged course about leaving the city and decided to stay put,\xe2\x80\x9d the paper said.\n\nREAD MORE: Pentagon pens ground op plans for Mosul as campaign falters \xe2\x80\x93 DEBKA\n\n\n\n'","b'Humanitarian organizations face serious difficulties in delivering aid to people inside Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Mosul amid the US-backed operation against Islamic State, Oxfam spokesman who returned from Iraq told RT.

b'WATCH: Bill Maher HAMMERS Trump In Final Plea To Voters On Fallon',"b'Bill Maher made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and made sure everyone knows exactly who Donald trump is and why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for him.\n\nFallon asked for Maher\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on the election and he did not disappoint. Maher conceded that Hillary is not the best candidate, but said she will be a good president.\n\nHe then slammed Trump for cheering for Russian hackers to keep committing espionage against the United States.\n\nWhen the subject of \xe2\x80\x9clocker room talk\xe2\x80\x9d came up, Maher was even more emphatic.\n\nMaher said that what Trump said is not \xe2\x80\x9clocker room talk,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s a guy bragging about committing sexual assault. \xe2\x80\x9cGOP now stands for grab our p*ssies,\xe2\x80\x9d Maher declared.\n\nWhen Fallon joked that it sounds like Maher supports Trump, Maher got serious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not funny,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a different thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did a whole mea culpa on my show Friday night, I talked about Mitt Romney, George Bush, Reagan, McCain like it was the end of the world. It would never have been the end of the world with those guys. This is different. This guy is different. They have no respect for the rule of law. It\xe2\x80\x99s only about vengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen asked what he would say to undecided voters, Maher made things simple.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, really? I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s a racist, a liar, a tax cheat, a deadbeat, a Russian agent, and a sexual predator. \xe2\x80\x98How do you find your way out of the door in the morning?\xe2\x80\x99 is what I would say to the undecideds.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMaher concluded by slamming conservatives for creating an alternate reality where America is failing and President Obama did a horrible jobs. The facts, however, paint a different story before unemployment is down to 4.9 percent and the stock market has more than recovered since the Great Recession.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the video via YouTube.\n\nAmericans need to vote in this election no matter what. The future of this nation depends on it.\n\nFeatured Image: Screenshot'","b""Bill Maher made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and made sure everyone knows exactly who Donald trump is and why we shouldn't vote for him.""",['Stephen D Foster Jr'],http://fb.me,0,0,0.5,1,12,332,29,1,0,0,0.133590535,0.375

b'Restoring Free Speech: The Trump Effect',"b'Trump has Americans timidly coming out from the shadows; feeling a little less afraid of exercising their Constitutional right to express their religious and political views\n\nRestoring Free Speech: The Trump Effect\n\nYears ago, Rush Limbaugh coined the term, \xe2\x80\x9cLow-info Voters.\xe2\x80\x9d The term perfectly describes Americans, like 95% of my family, who only get their news from the mainstream media. Consequently, low-info voters do not know that the mainstream media is not fair and balanced. The mainstream media has become strong-arm enforcers of political correctness and operatives of the Democrat Party; 100% focused and committed to furthering the socialist/progressive agenda. Yes, I remember when I was a kid my black Baltimore City firefighter dad told me, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Republicans are for the rich and the Democrats are for the little guy; the working man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few years ago, I was able to convince my 89-year-old dad that this \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d his Democrat Party of his youth. Dad\xe2\x80\x99s Democrat Party has been hijacked by old hippies. They reject Christianity while vowing to arrest anyone speaking badly of Islam. They use public schools to teach our kids to despise all things traditional, wholesome, patriotic and good. They are the ones who have, for the most part, made it criminal to publicly say you believe marriage should remain as it has been for thousands of years and how God intended; between one man and one woman (Genesis 2:24). They are the ones banning Nativity scenes and banning saying \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d They are the ones banning teachers addressing students as boys and girls, claiming gender distinctions are intolerant, discriminatory and bigoted. They are the ones pushing the extinction of blacks via a disproportionate high number of black abortions. This it why it continues to frost me when low-info idiots in my black \xe2\x80\x9cChristian\xe2\x80\x9d family continue to pledge their brain-dead loyalty to Democrats while calling me their Uncle Tom relative. The Left uses a highly effective tactic. They brand any push-back to them cramming their progressive agenda down our throats \xe2\x80\x9cextremism.\xe2\x80\x9d This tactic works great with so many low-info voters.\n\nHere is how it works. The Left says they want burly men with beards, dressed like lumberjacks to be permitted to use women restrooms if they inwardly feel like a woman that day. Husbands, fathers and brothers across America politically said, No-way. We are not allowing grown men in restrooms with our little girls, wives and mothers. Government mandating this insane restroom policy and Leftist businesses like Target embracing it has led to rapes and molestation in women restrooms. And yet, guess who the mainstream media and Democrats attack, calling them extremist? Answer: All who oppose men in women restrooms. In an attempt to demonize and silence American\xe2\x80\x99s common-sense disagreement, the Left claims anyone opposing men in women restrooms hates homosexuals and want to see them tortured and murdered. If you oppose the Left removing crosses from memorials, removing the Ten Commandments from public buildings, banning Nativity scenes and banning saying \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas\xe2\x80\x9d, the Left claims you\xe2\x80\x99re an extremist who hates homosexuals, suppresses women and want to cram your religion down everyone\xe2\x80\x99s throat. Do you see how the Left\xe2\x80\x99s extremism tactic works? They are the aggressors, but call you an extremist when you simply say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d Clearly, the Left has launched a pedal-to-the-metal campaign to cram their progressive agenda down our throats. For example: A Zales jewelry TV commercial featured a lesbian wedding. Homosexuals are only 2% of the population. So why is featuring a lesbian wedding necessary? Fearful to admit it, most Americans still instinctively know marriage is between one man and one woman. But if they dare say it out loud, the Left will try to destroy them by branding their belief in tradition and biblical teaching extreme; outrageously claiming they hate homosexuals and want to see them tortured and murdered. The Left\xe2\x80\x99s tactic of branding the slightest opposition \xe2\x80\x9cextremism\xe2\x80\x9d has silenced many. I believe Trump in the WH has already begun liberating Americans from the Left\xe2\x80\x99s tyranny of political correctness; muzzling free speech. I realize the Left will distort my statement to mean Trump has opened the flood gates to express hate. Nonsense.\n\nContinued below... Leftists are boldly, relentlessly spewing hate against Jesus, Christians, Republicans, Conservatives (black and white), white people and police The truth is Leftists are the ones who boldly and relentlessly spew hate against Jesus, Christians, Republicans, Conservatives (black and white), white people and police. Heck, Leftists have even given marching orders to their minions, declaring it open season on killing whites and police. Have you heard the slightest rebuke from the mainstream media? No. All I am saying is Trump has Americans timidly coming out from the shadows; feeling a little less afraid of exercising their Constitutional right to express their religious and political views.

b'Opinion | The Senate Bathroom Angle',"b'We are sorely in need of some cheerful news out of Washington, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you Barbara Mikulski\xe2\x80\x99s story about the Senate bathrooms.\n\nAlmost every veteran woman legislator, in every level of government, has a story about the shortage of bathroom facilities at work. Really, there needs to be a book on this. It could have a happy ending, and none of the chapters would involve Russian attempts to manipulate an election.\n\nMikulski, 80, has served in Congress longer than any other woman in history.

She was a social worker who got into Democratic politics during a battle to stop a planned highway that was threatening the ethnic Baltimore neighborhoods she loved. It was an unusual career route at the time, but she was an unusual person. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things they said was that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look the part,\xe2\x80\x9d Mikulski, who is 4-foot-11, recalled. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 You know, chunky and I have a definite blue-collar style, so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to the manner born, to the trust fund inherited.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe classic way for a woman to win a seat in the Senate was to follow a famous male relative. Many of her predecessors were widows who succeeded their husbands. Nancy Kassebaum, the only other woman in the Senate when Mikulski arrived, was the daughter of the Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon.'","b'We are sorely in need of some cheerful news out of Washington, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you Barbara Mikulski\xe2\x80\x99s story.'",[],http://www.nytimes.com,0,0,0.5,0,6,244,21,0,0,0,0.2075,0.4

b'The Every Student Succeeds Act will Fail - The Boston Globe',"b'Across the country, schools and school districts have begun to implement the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. The law is the latest reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first passed in 1965. Yet, despite the fanfare and promise to usher in a new era, this newest version \xe2\x80\x94 like so many federal and state schemes to implement high standards for student learning \xe2\x80\x94 will fail. The regulatory process associated with implementation will inevitably corrupt the law\xe2\x80\x99s intent.\n\nI have witnessed this again and again in my 35 years as a teacher \xe2\x80\x94 a front-row seat from which I have viewed the deadening impact on schools and classrooms of standards as regulatory tools. At the same time, however, I have also been inspired by the inventive ways that school-level educators and communities have used similar standards to foster powerful learning.\n\nIn 1989, I joined a circle of colleagues and parents frustrated by the focus on testing of the well-regarded high school in our suburban community near Albany, N.Y. At the time, New York State\xe2\x80\x99s curriculum consisted of thick manuals with long lists of learning objectives and a battery of tests, the vaunted Regents Exams. Our small group asked: How can we engage students in learning more fully beyond a narrow desire to ace the exam?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of several years we designed and launched an alternative school-within-a-school, in which tests took a back seat to projects designed to simulate real world problems. Each semester, students in the Bethlehem Lab School presented their work before a panel of adults drawn from the community. The high stakes of a juried exhibition pushed our students to focus, and the complex nature of the work forced them to think more deeply and broadly than they were accustomed.\n\nGet Arguable in your inbox: Jeff Jacoby on everything from politics to pet peeves to the passions of the day. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here\n\nOur students didn\xe2\x80\x99t take Regents Exams. At the time, students in New York State could opt for a \xe2\x80\x9clocal\xe2\x80\x9d diploma instead. We chose this lower status designation as an entire school to free ourselves to create a more demanding curriculum, based on New York State\xe2\x80\x99s own learning standards. It turned out that at the back of all those thick curriculum books put out by the state stood an elegantly simple list of 10 goals. It fit on one page. It was our constitution. And though the Regents curriculum was, theoretically, based on the 10 goals, the process of parsing out learning objectives in each subject and the demands of psychometricians for reliability and validity resulted in a curriculum overweight with content, instruction focused on memorization, and tests that rewarded students able to retain lots and lots of information. The system demanded compliance more than it fostered learning.\n\nSeveral years later, I was invited to join a new public charter school in Massachusetts as principal teacher. The Francis W. Parker Charter Essential School was founded by parents and educators who pioneered an approach to standards and assessment in which each student continuously created original work assembled into a portfolio. Revision was encouraged, and standards were printed on posters hung on the walls of every classroom. Students worked hard to improve their essays, lab reports, and projects until they met the standards, and when they demonstrated to their teachers and classmates through a live exhibition that the standards were met, they were promoted.\n\nThose were heady times in Massachusetts. The Education Reform Act of 1993 that enabled charter schools also promised a statewide assessment system to include portfolios and other forms of \xe2\x80\x9cauthentic\xe2\x80\x9d assessment like those at the Lab School and the Parker School. But first, under political pressure, regulators were compelled to generate thick manuals of finely parsed learning objectives. Then, the psychometricians went to work figuring out how to measure learning. Shortly, the Department of Education rolled out a battery of on-demand tests, with the grandiose title of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or what we know today more often as the MCAS. No portfolios and nothing authentic about them. Again, compliance ruled the day. Teachers and students would have to fall in line.\n\n2001 saw passage of the No Child Left Behind Act. Standards as regulatory tool, in force in some states, became the law of the land. They called it accountability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2006, after 25 years in schools, I reinvented myself as an assistant professor at a nearby university. I wanted to know: Were my experiences part of a larger pattern? I quickly learned two things. The first is that there is a boatload of research showing that accountability has narrowed the curriculum nationwide and turned schools serving our nation\xe2\x80\x99s neediest students into test prep factories. And the second is legions of education researchers have seized on the rising tide of test data to answer their questions. The answers are often simplistic in ways that belie the complexity of schools and classrooms, while legitimizing the testing culture.\n\nAs evidence has mounted that the accountability regime is turning many schools into test prep centers, advocates for accountability have argued that schools need not slavishly teach to the test. Instead, they say, schools should offer a robust curriculum with demanding instruction, and the tests will take care of themselves. This sounds like common sense, but in a study I just completed with Megin Charner-Laird of Salem State University and Stacy Szczesiul of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, we found that schools with reliably high test scores \xe2\x80\x94 while not teaching to the test per se \xe2\x80\x94 tend to teach a limited range of skills required for the test. Teachers and administrators told us they would aspire to something more, but this is what the system demands.\n\nAt schools like the Lab School and the Parker School, demanding standards, attached to assessments that rely on judgment, foster powerful learning. At the system level, strict reliance on measurement, where judgment is expunged as a contaminant, has served to narrow learning and diminish student engagement.\n\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA as it is known, holds on to this fundamental element of the accountability movement like a dog does a bone. Meanwhile, a Gallup Student Poll administered last fall shows 68 percent of high school juniors unengaged in school. Portfolios, juried exhibitions, external audits, peer review \xe2\x80\x94 all of which rely on judgment informed with evidence \xe2\x80\x94 have been marginalized at the system level, but they are exactly what works at the local level in pushing students to think deeply and engage in learning. Perhaps after ESSA fails to deliver, we will get the message, and a new policy regime will be driven not by the question how do we measure X, but, instead, how do we engage and inspire children and youth?\n\nJames Nehring is a former Fulbright Scholar and an associate professor of education at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

"b'Confirmed: Mainstream Media Guilty of Treason, Crimes Against Humanity---Major Cover-ups Continue! | Alternative'","b'Confirmed: Mainstream Media Guilty of Treason, Crimes Against Humanity\xe2\x80\x94Major Cover-ups Continue!\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n\nTHE MILLENNIUM REPORT: Reporting the Most Important News in the World Today.\n\nMAINSTREAM MEDIA:\n\nThe True Enemy Of The People\n\nMSM Guilty of Multiple Ongoing Cover-ups\n\nof Major Government and Corporate Crimes\n\n*\n\n9/11 VERDICT: Mainstream Media Guilty Of The Biggest Coverup In U.S. History ( VIDEO\n\n\n\nState of the Nation\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery major organ of the Mainstream Media has\n\nquite willingly participated in the ongoing cover-up\n\nof the Crime of the Millennium\xe2\x80\x94the 9/11 false flag\n\nterror attacks in New York City and Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d[1]\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Veteran 9/11 Investigator\n\nTo many it is now quite obvious that the mainstream media (MSM) is the real enemy of We the People.\n\nStated more accurately it is the owners of the MSM who are the real enemies of the American Republic.\n\nActually, it is those clandestine powers who control the MSM owners, via multiple control mechanisms, who are the true enemies of the American people \xe2\x80\xa6 as well as the world community of nations.\n\nIndisputable Fact: Until this harsh reality is dealt with decisively and firmly,\n\nthere can be no real change throughout the planetary civilization.\n\nVery few are aware, but whoever controls the mainstream media effectively controls the world. That\xe2\x80\x99s because whoever controls the flow of information, controls the minds of the global population.\n\nWhoever Controls The Media Controls The World\n\nThe next logical step in this critical research project is to ask:\n\nWho REALLY Controls The Mainstream Media?\n\nWhy is the 9/11 cover-up so important?\n\nThe highly coordinated cover-up of the U.S. government-directed terror attacks on 9/11 is quite representative of all the major cover-ups throughout modern American history. The true perpetrators utilized the same MO as they did to cover-up the assassination of John of Kennedy \xe2\x80\xa6 the Oklahoma City Bombing \xe2\x80\xa6 the Sandy Hook School \xe2\x80\x98massacre\xe2\x80\x99, etc. Hence, when one understands how they can successfully cover-up such a massive crime as 9/11, it is then easier to see why they routinely employ the same basic game plan whenever they so choose.\n\n9/11 TRUTH GOES NUCLEAR: Massive Download In Progress\n\nFor anyone who has conducted even a modicum of research into the 9/11 black operation, it quickly becomes clear that not only did the U.S. Federal Government coordinate the biggest cover-up in American history, they could only have done so with the full knowledge and support of every major news platform within the MSM.[2]\n\n9/11 Commission Report: The Most Ridiculous Conspiracy Theory Of All Time\n\nPoint of Fact: Without the intimate involvement of the MSM,\n\nthe 9/11 cover-up could not have succeeded.\n\nTREASON & TRAITORS\n\nIn light of the [ONGOING] 9/11 cover-up, it can be stated with absolute certainty that the MSM is guilty of the cover-up of state-sponsored terrorism (by the US government), various crimes against humanity, the countless war crimes of the post 9/11 wars, and high treason of the highest order.\n\n9/11 FACT: The Pentagon Was Hit By A Cruise Missile From The US Military Arsenal\n\nWhere it concerns the 9/11 false flag operation, the degree of treachery demonstrated by the MSM against the American people is unprecedented in its depth and breadth. Their profound betrayal of the U.S. citizenry through the implementation of the MSM cover-up is both shocking for its sheer audacity as it is stunning for its naked malevolence.\n\nWhat is crucial to understand here is that where the original crime was carried out over 15 years ago, the enormous cover-up continues up to this very day. Therefore, the duration and severity and number of the myriad MSM cover-up crimes grows by the day. As matter of fact, the unprovoked wars of aggression prosecuted by the Obama Administration in the Mideast and elsewhere have only occurred only because of the success of the MSM 9/11 cover-up.\n\nWar on Terror Justified With 9/11 False Flag Terror Attacks\n\nIn view of this irrefutable state of affairs, it can be asserted that those who populate the highest echelons of the entire corporate media are traitors and turncoats. Who they really serve can only be surmised, but their loyalties do not lie with the American Republic. Because the continuing 9/11 cover-up requires so much day-to-day dissemination of known falsehoods and fabricated lies, those who staff the major organs of the MSM at even the lower levels are likewise guilty of treason.\n\nThere is only one realistic solution to this ever-worsening MSM predicament.\n\nThe mainstream media in its current form must be shut down and removed from American civil society. Or, it must be completely taken over by a newly constituted U.S. Federal Government that truly serves the interests of the American people, as well as the world-at-large.\n\nAny endeavor that is undertaken that does not include one of these two execution plans is essentially worthless. That\xe2\x80\x99s because there can be no meaningful dissemination of the truth, or reconciliation throughout the nation, until the power of the press is fully restored to the people themselves. Absent this successful initiative, there can be no justice, nor will there be any peace, at home or abroad. The influence of the American MSM is far too great worldwide and therefore needs to be radically transformed into a force for good.\n\nExactly how the new media platforms are constructed remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the country has seen everything about how NOT to run a media operation, so building a new enterprise based on truth, and run with integrity, ought to be fairly straightforward. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply called: \xe2\x80\x9cTell the Truth\xe2\x80\x94Always!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current corporate MSM must be shut down and taken over. The sooner the better, as no meaningful change can take place as long as it continues to operate against the interests of the American people.\n\nThose individuals who own and operate, direct and oversee, the major corporate media companies need to be arrested post haste for treason and other serious crimes. They should be imprisoned without bail until their trials by jury can be conducted by a special 9/11 Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Within this legal framework and judicial format, they ought to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nMany media analysts and political commentators in the alternative media have suggested that those who are found guilty \xe2\x80\x94 of both the 9/11 crimes and cover-up \xe2\x80\x94 must be given the harshest punishments possible to serve as a powerful deterrent to all future traitors to the American Republic.\n\nThe Neocon Zionists Must Be Arrested And Put On Trial For False Flag 9/11 Terrorism\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s get busy!\n\nState of the Nation\n\nOctober 3, 2016\n\nSource\n\n[1] 9/11 VERDICT: Mainstream Media Guilty Of The Biggest Coverup In US History\n\n[2] 9/11: The Ultimate Inside Job And False Flag Operation\n\nReferences\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Official\xe2\x80\x99 NIST Report Shattered by Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth\n\n9/11: Russia Presents Evidence Against US, UK And Israel Co-Conspirators\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nNEOCON CABAL: A Stone-Cold Terrorist Cell Occupies The U.S. Federal Government\n\n___\n\nMAINSTREAM MEDIA: The True Enemy Of The People | SOTN: Alternative News & Commentary\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nTHE MILLENNIUM REPORT: Reporting the Most Important News in the World Today.\n\nWe encourage you to Share our Reports, Analyses, Breaking News and Videos.
