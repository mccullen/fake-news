The State has turned off all of our water including our wells!,"We are not happy about this at all. Four years ago they started turning off our surface water. Two years ago they turned off our house water from a spring and now they are trying to turn off our irrigation wells. On the wells, they are going to have a fight (legal). The details of that will be skipped as that battle has just started.

What is more important is how blatant the Oregon Department of Water Resources Staff is about this. There was a meeting last Monday, where they were happy to explain how their computer model tells them that 140 wells that are closer than 1 mile to a river are denying the rivers over 100 cubic feet per second(cfs), but the wells that are one foot over a mile from the river are not hurting the river enough to bother. That right there should tell you there is a problem with what they are doing.

I assert the model has no correlation to the real world. How can I back that up you ask?

I can back that up several ways. The easiest way is looking at the river flow. There is a gauge station on the Lower Williamson River that has been there for 100 years. For those paying attention 100 years of data is a lot of data. Most of the irrigation wells have been drilled since 1950. That means we have river data for 32 years before the wells were drilled. In those 32 years the  average flow is 860cfs. Since 1951 the average flow is 1052cfs. That means since the wells have been drilled there is almost another 200 cfs in the rivers.

That does not sound like the wells are drying up the rivers. In fact, a person could argue that the wells are helping the river flows in a number of ways.",,Brandan  Topham,http://farmwars.info/,0,1526169600000,1,1,12,311,0,0,0,0.0,0.08739495798319329,0.0,0.02913165266106443
Bill Gates has paid more Taxes than anyone in the History of the World!!!,"Technology innovator and billionaire Bill Gates has paid more taxes than anyone in the history of the world, and he says he is happy to pay even more. The co-founder of Microsoft is currently worth an estimated US $91.8 billion and has paid a total of over US $10 billion in taxes to the US government. Speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, the Microsoft billionaire revealed the staggering amount he pays in taxes.


 
“I have paid more taxes, over US $10 billion, than anyone else, but the government should require people in my position to pay significantly higher taxes,” he said.

Bill Gates spoke about the need for the US government to increase the estate tax, which favours the super rich as the wealth they leave behind is taxed at a very low percentage at the current tax rate.


 
The billionaire and philanthropist has called upon other rich Americans and people around the world to join his giving pledge in which they will leave a big chunk of their wealth to charity. Among the billionaires who have signed Bill Gates pledge are Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and veteran billionaire investor Warren Buffet.

"Hyde-Smith defeats Espy in Mississippi special election runoff, expanding GOP Senate majority","Republicans on Tuesday expanded their incoming Senate majority to 53 seats, as incumbent Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith handily beat back an insurgent challenge by Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi's special election runoff to become the first woman ever elected to Congress from the state.

With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Hyde-Smith had 446,927 votes to Espy's 374,880 -- a commanding margin of 54.4 percent to 45.6 percent, according to state election officials. The race marks the final midterm contest of 2018.

“I want everybody to know, no matter who you voted for today, I’m gonna always represent every Mississippian,” Hyde-Smith said at her victory party late Monday night.  ""Being on that MAGA-wagon, the Make American Great Again bus, we have bonded, we have persevered, we have gotten through things, we were successful today.""

Hyde-Smith, 59, is an ardent supporter of President Trump who was appointed earlier this year by Mississippi's governor to fill retiring Sen. Thad Cochran's seat. She will finish out the remaining two years of Cochran's term in the deep-red state that went for President Trump by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.

Hyde-Smith's win gives Republicans more leeway to ensure the confirmation of Trump's federal judicial and Cabinet nominees that require Senate approval, and strengthens the party's chances of holding the majority in 2020.

""She has my prayers as she goes to Washington to unite a very divided Mississippi,"" Espy said in his concession speech.

“Cindy Hyde-Smith has been a strong conservative voice since joining the Senate, so it should come as no surprise that she was elected by Mississippians to represent them in Washington,” National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Cory Gardner said in a statement. “Senator Hyde-Smith won tonight because she has a trusted record of fighting for Mississippi, and we are happy she will be returning to the United States Senate.”

On Nov. 6, Hyde-Smith prevailed in a four-way race that included firebrand Republican Sen. Chris McDaniel -- but she was unable to secure more than 50 percent of the vote amid heavy turnout, owing to McDaniel's strong showing. The Nov. 6 election -- which saw nearly half of registered voters in Mississippi cast ballots in the Senate race-- triggered Tuesday's runoff.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith's Republican Senate colleagues are standing up for her in her runoff race against Democrat Mike Espy; Peter Doocy reports from Jackson, Mississippi.

McDaniel sharply criticized Hyde-Smith throughout the campaign for being insufficiently supportive of the president's agenda, and some analysts suggested he may have dampened enthusiasm among conservatives for her candidacy.

“There has been a lot of work done to make sure that McDaniel’s supporters will turn out, but the hardest part about runoff elections is getting people to turn out,” Jennifer Duffy, the senior editor for the Cook Political Report, told Fox News. “If they don’t turn out, McDaniel will be seen as the spoiler because if it wasn’t for him, there would not have been a runoff in the first place.”

McDaniel offered only a lukewarm endorsement for Hyde-Smith after his defeat earlier in the month, saying, ""I don't believe she's the conservative for this state."" He also told his supporters that ""President Trump wants us to unite, and we will unite"" to back her.

Espy “cannot be allowed to win this seat,” McDaniel said shortly after conceding the race, according to Mississippi Today. “President Trump wants us to unite, and we will unite. We will back Cindy Hyde-Smith.”

The 64-year-old Espy, who was vying to become Mississippi's first black senator since Reconstruction, had previously served in Congress and in former President Bill Clinton's administration.

Mississippi last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1982, but Espy was trying for the same kind of longshot win that fellow Democrat Doug Jones had nearly a year ago in neighboring Alabama, another conservative Deep South state where Republicans hold most statewide offices.

His campaign gained a second wind amid a flurry of damaging reports and missteps that inundated Hyde-Smith's campaign in recent days. Mississippi's past of racist violence became a dominant theme in the race after a video showed Hyde-Smith praising a supporter in early November by saying, ""If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row."" She said it was ""an exaggerated expression of regard.""

As voters headed to the polls, nooses were found outside Mississippi State Capitol, along with signs explaining that they were placed there by protesters who wanted to raise awareness about the state's history of racially motivated lynchings. Some media figures inaccurately blamed Hyde-Smith supporters for placing the nooses.

""So many things are taken out of context,"" said Elizabeth Gallinghouse, 84, from Diamondhead, Mississippi. ""The fact that she toured Jefferson Davis's house. You or I could have done the same thing. They said, 'Put this cap on. Hold this gun.' It was a fun time. She wasn't trying to send any messages.""

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL BECOMES LATEST BIG MONEY DONOR TO DEMAND MONEY BACK FROM HYDE-SMITH

More than a week after the video's release, Hyde-Smith apologized at a televised debate to ""anyone that was offended by my comments,"" but also said the remark was used as a ""weapon"" against her. Espy responded: ""I don't know what's in your heart, but I know what came out of your mouth.""

Some corporate donors, including Walmart and Major League Baseball, requested refunds on their campaign contributions to Hyde-Smith after the videos surfaced.

Hyde-Smith was seen in another video talking about making voting difficult for ""liberal folks,"" and a photo circulated showing her wearing a replica Confederate military hat during a 2014 visit to Beauvoir, a beachside museum in Biloxi, Mississippi, that was the last home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis.

Sen. Hyde-Smith's gaffes tighten Mississippi Senate raceVideo
Critics said Hyde-Smith's comments and Confederate regalia showed callous indifference in a state with a 38-percent black population, and some corporate donors, including Walmart, requested refunds on their campaign contributions to her.

However, Espy has had his own negative press in the run-up to the runoff. In particular, the Hyde-Smith campaign hammered Espy for his $750,000 lobbying contract in 2011 with the Cocoa and Coffee Board of the Ivory Coast. She noted that the country's ex-president, Laurent Gbagbo, is being tried in the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

Espy, who is an attorney, said: ""I found out later that this guy, the president, was a really bad guy. I resigned the contract.""

""She stood up to the Democrat smear machine.""

— President Trump
Espy resigned as President Bill Clinton's agriculture secretary in 1994 amid a special-counsel investigation that accused him of improperly accepting gifts. He was tried and acquitted on 30 corruption charges, but the Mississippi Republican Party ran an ad this year that called Espy ""too corrupt for the Clintons"" and ""too liberal for Mississippi.""

Espy said he refused to accept offers of plea deals because, ""I was so not guilty, I was innocent.""

The significance of the race was not lost on President Trump or top Republicans, who headlined two major rallies Monday night for Hyde-Smith in Mississippi to boost turnout.

""If you like [Supreme Court Justice Brett] Kavanuagh, there's more coming,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told the crowd in Tupelo, Miss. ""Let's win tomorrow.""

""She stood up to the Democrat smear machine,"" Trump said, referring to Hyde-Smith's support for Kavanaugh amid a series of uncorroborated and lurid sexual misconduct allegations.

He added: ""Your vote on Tuesday will decide whether we build on our extraordinary achievements, or whether we empower the radical Democrats to obstruct our progress.""

Hyde-Smith, who has made the Trump rallies a highlight of her runoff campaign, told the crowd in Tupelo: ""I worked very, very hard for you. I have stood up for you and you know I will continue to stand up for the conservative values of Mississippi.""

INSANE: Migrant caravan shoved women and children to the FRONT so they would be photographed with tear gas… then media blames Trump,"(Natural News) As the caravan migrant “crisis” festers along the U.S.-Mexico border, our Leftist “establishment” media continue to misrepresent what is actually occurring so they can lay the blame for it at the feet of POTUS Donald Trump.

Earlier this week the media, and like-minded talking heads on various cable news outlets, were outraged (again) over images showing “women and children” being “gassed” by U.S. Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agents. 

As reported by The National Sentinel, what ‘the media’ failed to report was why anyone was gassed: Male migrants became overly aggressive, stormed the border, and began pelting agents with rocks and bottles. San Diego Chief Border Patrol Agent Rodney Scott said that personnel did not use tear gas, pepper balls, and other dispersion techniques until after his agents were attacked. “Several agents were actually struck by rocks,” Scott said.

Regarding the images taken by the establishment media showing women and children caught up in the melee, they were physically placed in front by the attacking migrants. 

“What we saw over and over yesterday was that the group — the caravan, as we call them — would push women and children to the front and then begin, basically, rocking our agents,” Scott said.

“They use women and children regularly,” National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told The Daily Caller. 

Breitbart News confirmed this, publishing additional comments from Scott, who said he found it “unconscionable” that anyone “would take children intentionally into this situation.” (Related: Border Patrol chief says Army can’t stop migrant invasion, only new laws and ‘a wall’ can.)

Sponsored solution from the Health Ranger Store: Lab-verified Nascent Iodine solution is a dietary supplement that provides your body with supplemental iodine to help protect your thyroid during radiation exposure. Nuclear accidents such as Fukushima (or nuclear war) can expose your body to radioactive iodine-131, a dangerous radioisotope. Pre-loading your system with stable iodine occupies the iodine receptor sites on your organs, causing your body to naturally expel radioactive iodine you may have been exposed to through air, food, water or milk products. This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Discover more at this link.

He also noted that agents do not and did not target any women and children with tear gas.

“We try specifically to target the instigators, the person assaulting the agent. But as you saw, once that chemical is released, it does go through the air … I inhaled quite a bit of it yesterday,” he said, adding:

We are in the process of building the new border wall here, but we don’t have it completed. There were some sections that had the dilapidated border wall that was made out of scrap metal the military gave us.

The group breached a couple sections of that, actually tore down one small section, started to rush across. And that’s another time that they started assaulting our agents. We were able to hold them back using riot-type, riot techniques. But there were, ultimately 42 arrests of individuals. And again, as I mentioned, the vast majority of those were adult males.

NOT the president’s fault
The “vast majority” of people comprising the caravans — a great many of whom appear to be military-aged males — are attempting to claim economic hardship as their impetus for wanting asylum in the U.S., Scott said.

But as Border Patrol Council spokesman Chris Cabrera told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham Monday night on her show, “The Ingraham Angle,” claiming to want a better life or a better job are not valid reasons for granting asylum.

“They know they’re taking advantage of the system, and they know there is nothing we can do about it,” he said, adding that the strategy of invading the U.S. border en masse is to gain access one way or another because thanks to existing law, anyone who enters — legally or otherwise — can claim asylum within a year.

He added that none of the chaos along the U.S.-Mexico border is POTUS Trump’s fault, despite the media’s best efforts to blame him.

“The president can’t be held responsible for this. There’s only so much he can do. He has called for an additional 5,000 border patrol agents, yet Congress has failed to act on that. If we had that, we wouldn’t be in this situation where we needed the military to come in and help us,” he said.

New Ebola Outbreak Reaches A Major City In Congo As The WHO Warns About The Possibility Of “An Explosive Increase In Cases”,"The worst Ebola outbreak in a number of years has health officials on high alert, and the fact that a case is now being reported in a major city is extremely concerning. As we have seen during past outbreaks, Ebola can spread very rapidly, and the mortality rate during an outbreak is often above 50 percent. A few years ago, just rumors that Ebola might start spreading inside the United States caused quite a bit of panic out there. Let us hope that this current outbreak is brought under control quickly, because Ebola is a horrible, horrible disease.

The reason why there is so much concern at the moment is because a brand new case of Ebola is being reported in a city of more than a million people. The following comes from NPR…

A new case of Ebola has emerged in an urban area of Democratic Republic of the Congo, a troubling development in the country’s new outbreak of the contagious and often fatal virus. Until now, the outbreak had affected a rural area.

Dr. Oly Ilunga, Congo’s minister of health, announced Wednesday that a suspected case was confirmed in Mbandaka, a city of about 1.2 million people, and the capital of the Équateur Province.

Ebola can spread much more rapidly in urban areas because people live so much closer together. Up until now, this latest outbreak has been confined to rural areas…

WHO says 44 cases of Ebola have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — most in a remote, northwestern province that is very hard to reach. More than 20 people have died.

Global health officials are monitoring this outbreak very closely, and hopefully that will keep this outbreak confined. But it is important to note that one top WHO official is warning that we are now facing the possibility of “an explosive increase in cases”…

“This is a major development in the outbreak,” said Peter Salama, the WHO’s deputy director general of emergency preparedness and response. “We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola. The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.”

There is certainly no reason for anyone in the United States to panic at this point, but it is always a good idea to be prepared for any situation. The following are some thoughts from prepping expert Daisy Luther…

At this point, we have no reason to be overly concerned if we are not in the DRC, however, it pays to be watchful and prepared. The last time around, it made it to the United States and it was nearly impossible to get supplies by the time it was diagnosed here.

From a preparedness point of view, if an outbreak occurs, social isolation is the number one way to prevent becoming ill. The death rate for someone who contracts Ebola is 50%. Ebola is the potential pandemic that really keeps me up at night. It’s scary stuff. This article explains how a localized outbreak can turn into a pandemic.

We will continue to monitor this outbreak, and we will bring you any important updates as they become available.

And I apologize for not writing very much so far in 2018. I put everything that I had into running for office, and now that campaign has ended. I will continue to endeavor to make a difference through my writing, and I want to thank all of my regular readers for the tremendous amount of patience that they have had with me in recent months.

Now I will be resuming a normal writing schedule, and we have some big things planned for the very near future.
