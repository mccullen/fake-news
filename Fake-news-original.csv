The State has turned off all of our water including our wells!,"We are not happy about this at all. Four years ago they started turning off our surface water. Two years ago they turned off our house water from a spring and now they are trying to turn off our irrigation wells. On the wells, they are going to have a fight (legal). The details of that will be skipped as that battle has just started.

What is more important is how blatant the Oregon Department of Water Resources Staff is about this. There was a meeting last Monday, where they were happy to explain how their computer model tells them that 140 wells that are closer than 1 mile to a river are denying the rivers over 100 cubic feet per second(cfs), but the wells that are one foot over a mile from the river are not hurting the river enough to bother. That right there should tell you there is a problem with what they are doing.

I assert the model has no correlation to the real world. How can I back that up you ask?

I can back that up several ways. The easiest way is looking at the river flow. There is a gauge station on the Lower Williamson River that has been there for 100 years. For those paying attention 100 years of data is a lot of data. Most of the irrigation wells have been drilled since 1950. That means we have river data for 32 years before the wells were drilled. In those 32 years the  average flow is 860cfs. Since 1951 the average flow is 1052cfs. That means since the wells have been drilled there is almost another 200 cfs in the rivers.

That does not sound like the wells are drying up the rivers. In fact, a person could argue that the wells are helping the river flows in a number of ways.",,Brandan  Topham,http://farmwars.info/,0,1526169600000,1,1,12,311,0,0,0,0.0,0.08739495798319329,0.0,0.02913165266106443
Bill Gates has paid more Taxes than anyone in the History of the World!!!,"Technology innovator and billionaire Bill Gates has paid more taxes than anyone in the history of the world, and he says he is happy to pay even more. The co-founder of Microsoft is currently worth an estimated US $91.8 billion and has paid a total of over US $10 billion in taxes to the US government. Speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, the Microsoft billionaire revealed the staggering amount he pays in taxes.


 
“I have paid more taxes, over US $10 billion, than anyone else, but the government should require people in my position to pay significantly higher taxes,” he said.

Bill Gates spoke about the need for the US government to increase the estate tax, which favours the super rich as the wealth they leave behind is taxed at a very low percentage at the current tax rate.


 
The billionaire and philanthropist has called upon other rich Americans and people around the world to join his giving pledge in which they will leave a big chunk of their wealth to charity. Among the billionaires who have signed Bill Gates pledge are Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and veteran billionaire investor Warren Buffet.

"Hyde-Smith defeats Espy in Mississippi special election runoff, expanding GOP Senate majority","Republicans on Tuesday expanded their incoming Senate majority to 53 seats, as incumbent Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith handily beat back an insurgent challenge by Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi's special election runoff to become the first woman ever elected to Congress from the state.

With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Hyde-Smith had 446,927 votes to Espy's 374,880 -- a commanding margin of 54.4 percent to 45.6 percent, according to state election officials. The race marks the final midterm contest of 2018.

“I want everybody to know, no matter who you voted for today, I’m gonna always represent every Mississippian,” Hyde-Smith said at her victory party late Monday night.  ""Being on that MAGA-wagon, the Make American Great Again bus, we have bonded, we have persevered, we have gotten through things, we were successful today.""

Hyde-Smith, 59, is an ardent supporter of President Trump who was appointed earlier this year by Mississippi's governor to fill retiring Sen. Thad Cochran's seat. She will finish out the remaining two years of Cochran's term in the deep-red state that went for President Trump by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election.

Hyde-Smith's win gives Republicans more leeway to ensure the confirmation of Trump's federal judicial and Cabinet nominees that require Senate approval, and strengthens the party's chances of holding the majority in 2020.

""She has my prayers as she goes to Washington to unite a very divided Mississippi,"" Espy said in his concession speech.

“Cindy Hyde-Smith has been a strong conservative voice since joining the Senate, so it should come as no surprise that she was elected by Mississippians to represent them in Washington,” National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Chairman Cory Gardner said in a statement. “Senator Hyde-Smith won tonight because she has a trusted record of fighting for Mississippi, and we are happy she will be returning to the United States Senate.”

On Nov. 6, Hyde-Smith prevailed in a four-way race that included firebrand Republican Sen. Chris McDaniel -- but she was unable to secure more than 50 percent of the vote amid heavy turnout, owing to McDaniel's strong showing. The Nov. 6 election -- which saw nearly half of registered voters in Mississippi cast ballots in the Senate race-- triggered Tuesday's runoff.

Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith's Republican Senate colleagues are standing up for her in her runoff race against Democrat Mike Espy; Peter Doocy reports from Jackson, Mississippi.

McDaniel sharply criticized Hyde-Smith throughout the campaign for being insufficiently supportive of the president's agenda, and some analysts suggested he may have dampened enthusiasm among conservatives for her candidacy.

“There has been a lot of work done to make sure that McDaniel’s supporters will turn out, but the hardest part about runoff elections is getting people to turn out,” Jennifer Duffy, the senior editor for the Cook Political Report, told Fox News. “If they don’t turn out, McDaniel will be seen as the spoiler because if it wasn’t for him, there would not have been a runoff in the first place.”

McDaniel offered only a lukewarm endorsement for Hyde-Smith after his defeat earlier in the month, saying, ""I don't believe she's the conservative for this state."" He also told his supporters that ""President Trump wants us to unite, and we will unite"" to back her.

Espy “cannot be allowed to win this seat,” McDaniel said shortly after conceding the race, according to Mississippi Today. “President Trump wants us to unite, and we will unite. We will back Cindy Hyde-Smith.”

The 64-year-old Espy, who was vying to become Mississippi's first black senator since Reconstruction, had previously served in Congress and in former President Bill Clinton's administration.

Mississippi last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1982, but Espy was trying for the same kind of longshot win that fellow Democrat Doug Jones had nearly a year ago in neighboring Alabama, another conservative Deep South state where Republicans hold most statewide offices.

His campaign gained a second wind amid a flurry of damaging reports and missteps that inundated Hyde-Smith's campaign in recent days. Mississippi's past of racist violence became a dominant theme in the race after a video showed Hyde-Smith praising a supporter in early November by saying, ""If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row."" She said it was ""an exaggerated expression of regard.""

As voters headed to the polls, nooses were found outside Mississippi State Capitol, along with signs explaining that they were placed there by protesters who wanted to raise awareness about the state's history of racially motivated lynchings. Some media figures inaccurately blamed Hyde-Smith supporters for placing the nooses.

""So many things are taken out of context,"" said Elizabeth Gallinghouse, 84, from Diamondhead, Mississippi. ""The fact that she toured Jefferson Davis's house. You or I could have done the same thing. They said, 'Put this cap on. Hold this gun.' It was a fun time. She wasn't trying to send any messages.""

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL BECOMES LATEST BIG MONEY DONOR TO DEMAND MONEY BACK FROM HYDE-SMITH

More than a week after the video's release, Hyde-Smith apologized at a televised debate to ""anyone that was offended by my comments,"" but also said the remark was used as a ""weapon"" against her. Espy responded: ""I don't know what's in your heart, but I know what came out of your mouth.""

Some corporate donors, including Walmart and Major League Baseball, requested refunds on their campaign contributions to Hyde-Smith after the videos surfaced.

Hyde-Smith was seen in another video talking about making voting difficult for ""liberal folks,"" and a photo circulated showing her wearing a replica Confederate military hat during a 2014 visit to Beauvoir, a beachside museum in Biloxi, Mississippi, that was the last home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis.

Sen. Hyde-Smith's gaffes tighten Mississippi Senate raceVideo
Critics said Hyde-Smith's comments and Confederate regalia showed callous indifference in a state with a 38-percent black population, and some corporate donors, including Walmart, requested refunds on their campaign contributions to her.

However, Espy has had his own negative press in the run-up to the runoff. In particular, the Hyde-Smith campaign hammered Espy for his $750,000 lobbying contract in 2011 with the Cocoa and Coffee Board of the Ivory Coast. She noted that the country's ex-president, Laurent Gbagbo, is being tried in the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.

Espy, who is an attorney, said: ""I found out later that this guy, the president, was a really bad guy. I resigned the contract.""

""She stood up to the Democrat smear machine.""

— President Trump
Espy resigned as President Bill Clinton's agriculture secretary in 1994 amid a special-counsel investigation that accused him of improperly accepting gifts. He was tried and acquitted on 30 corruption charges, but the Mississippi Republican Party ran an ad this year that called Espy ""too corrupt for the Clintons"" and ""too liberal for Mississippi.""

Espy said he refused to accept offers of plea deals because, ""I was so not guilty, I was innocent.""

The significance of the race was not lost on President Trump or top Republicans, who headlined two major rallies Monday night for Hyde-Smith in Mississippi to boost turnout.

""If you like [Supreme Court Justice Brett] Kavanuagh, there's more coming,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told the crowd in Tupelo, Miss. ""Let's win tomorrow.""

""She stood up to the Democrat smear machine,"" Trump said, referring to Hyde-Smith's support for Kavanaugh amid a series of uncorroborated and lurid sexual misconduct allegations.

He added: ""Your vote on Tuesday will decide whether we build on our extraordinary achievements, or whether we empower the radical Democrats to obstruct our progress.""

Hyde-Smith, who has made the Trump rallies a highlight of her runoff campaign, told the crowd in Tupelo: ""I worked very, very hard for you. I have stood up for you and you know I will continue to stand up for the conservative values of Mississippi.""

INSANE: Migrant caravan shoved women and children to the FRONT so they would be photographed with tear gas… then media blames Trump,"(Natural News) As the caravan migrant “crisis” festers along the U.S.-Mexico border, our Leftist “establishment” media continue to misrepresent what is actually occurring so they can lay the blame for it at the feet of POTUS Donald Trump.

Earlier this week the media, and like-minded talking heads on various cable news outlets, were outraged (again) over images showing “women and children” being “gassed” by U.S. Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agents. 

As reported by The National Sentinel, what ‘the media’ failed to report was why anyone was gassed: Male migrants became overly aggressive, stormed the border, and began pelting agents with rocks and bottles. San Diego Chief Border Patrol Agent Rodney Scott said that personnel did not use tear gas, pepper balls, and other dispersion techniques until after his agents were attacked. “Several agents were actually struck by rocks,” Scott said.

Regarding the images taken by the establishment media showing women and children caught up in the melee, they were physically placed in front by the attacking migrants. 

“What we saw over and over yesterday was that the group — the caravan, as we call them — would push women and children to the front and then begin, basically, rocking our agents,” Scott said.

“They use women and children regularly,” National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told The Daily Caller. 

Breitbart News confirmed this, publishing additional comments from Scott, who said he found it “unconscionable” that anyone “would take children intentionally into this situation.” (Related: Border Patrol chief says Army can’t stop migrant invasion, only new laws and ‘a wall’ can.)

Sponsored solution from the Health Ranger Store: Lab-verified Nascent Iodine solution is a dietary supplement that provides your body with supplemental iodine to help protect your thyroid during radiation exposure. Nuclear accidents such as Fukushima (or nuclear war) can expose your body to radioactive iodine-131, a dangerous radioisotope. Pre-loading your system with stable iodine occupies the iodine receptor sites on your organs, causing your body to naturally expel radioactive iodine you may have been exposed to through air, food, water or milk products. This defensive strategy is recommended by nearly all health authorities, worldwide, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Discover more at this link.

He also noted that agents do not and did not target any women and children with tear gas.

“We try specifically to target the instigators, the person assaulting the agent. But as you saw, once that chemical is released, it does go through the air … I inhaled quite a bit of it yesterday,” he said, adding:

We are in the process of building the new border wall here, but we don’t have it completed. There were some sections that had the dilapidated border wall that was made out of scrap metal the military gave us.

The group breached a couple sections of that, actually tore down one small section, started to rush across. And that’s another time that they started assaulting our agents. We were able to hold them back using riot-type, riot techniques. But there were, ultimately 42 arrests of individuals. And again, as I mentioned, the vast majority of those were adult males.

NOT the president’s fault
The “vast majority” of people comprising the caravans — a great many of whom appear to be military-aged males — are attempting to claim economic hardship as their impetus for wanting asylum in the U.S., Scott said.

But as Border Patrol Council spokesman Chris Cabrera told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham Monday night on her show, “The Ingraham Angle,” claiming to want a better life or a better job are not valid reasons for granting asylum.

“They know they’re taking advantage of the system, and they know there is nothing we can do about it,” he said, adding that the strategy of invading the U.S. border en masse is to gain access one way or another because thanks to existing law, anyone who enters — legally or otherwise — can claim asylum within a year.

He added that none of the chaos along the U.S.-Mexico border is POTUS Trump’s fault, despite the media’s best efforts to blame him.

“The president can’t be held responsible for this. There’s only so much he can do. He has called for an additional 5,000 border patrol agents, yet Congress has failed to act on that. If we had that, we wouldn’t be in this situation where we needed the military to come in and help us,” he said.

New Ebola Outbreak Reaches A Major City In Congo As The WHO Warns About The Possibility Of “An Explosive Increase In Cases”,"The worst Ebola outbreak in a number of years has health officials on high alert, and the fact that a case is now being reported in a major city is extremely concerning. As we have seen during past outbreaks, Ebola can spread very rapidly, and the mortality rate during an outbreak is often above 50 percent. A few years ago, just rumors that Ebola might start spreading inside the United States caused quite a bit of panic out there. Let us hope that this current outbreak is brought under control quickly, because Ebola is a horrible, horrible disease.

The reason why there is so much concern at the moment is because a brand new case of Ebola is being reported in a city of more than a million people. The following comes from NPR…

A new case of Ebola has emerged in an urban area of Democratic Republic of the Congo, a troubling development in the country’s new outbreak of the contagious and often fatal virus. Until now, the outbreak had affected a rural area.

Dr. Oly Ilunga, Congo’s minister of health, announced Wednesday that a suspected case was confirmed in Mbandaka, a city of about 1.2 million people, and the capital of the Équateur Province.

Ebola can spread much more rapidly in urban areas because people live so much closer together. Up until now, this latest outbreak has been confined to rural areas…

WHO says 44 cases of Ebola have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — most in a remote, northwestern province that is very hard to reach. More than 20 people have died.

Global health officials are monitoring this outbreak very closely, and hopefully that will keep this outbreak confined. But it is important to note that one top WHO official is warning that we are now facing the possibility of “an explosive increase in cases”…

“This is a major development in the outbreak,” said Peter Salama, the WHO’s deputy director general of emergency preparedness and response. “We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola. The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.”

There is certainly no reason for anyone in the United States to panic at this point, but it is always a good idea to be prepared for any situation. The following are some thoughts from prepping expert Daisy Luther…

At this point, we have no reason to be overly concerned if we are not in the DRC, however, it pays to be watchful and prepared. The last time around, it made it to the United States and it was nearly impossible to get supplies by the time it was diagnosed here.

From a preparedness point of view, if an outbreak occurs, social isolation is the number one way to prevent becoming ill. The death rate for someone who contracts Ebola is 50%. Ebola is the potential pandemic that really keeps me up at night. It’s scary stuff. This article explains how a localized outbreak can turn into a pandemic.

We will continue to monitor this outbreak, and we will bring you any important updates as they become available.

And I apologize for not writing very much so far in 2018. I put everything that I had into running for office, and now that campaign has ended. I will continue to endeavor to make a difference through my writing, and I want to thank all of my regular readers for the tremendous amount of patience that they have had with me in recent months.

Now I will be resuming a normal writing schedule, and we have some big things planned for the very near future.

Washington Post: Trump says his 'gut' can tell him more than 'anybody else's brain can ever tell me',"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump blamed the General Motors plant closures and recent stock market dips on the Federal Reserve and the man he picked to lead it, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.

""I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed,"" Trump told the Post in an interview. ""They're making a mistake because I have a gut and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.""
GM announced Monday that it will shut production at five plants in North America and reduce its salaried workforce by 15%, including a quarter of the company's executives.
The President told the Post that he is ""not even a little bit happy"" with Jerome Powell, the man he picked to head the Federal Reserve.
Trump has long expressed frustration with Powell. Leading up to the November midterm elections, Trump repeatedly bashed him and called the Fed ""crazy"" and ""loco"" over recent interest-rate increases. Since July, Trump's repeated scrutiny of Powell has gradually escalated with new veiled threats that he might consider firing his Fed chairman.
In the wide-ranging interview with the Post, Trump also dismissed the US government report released last week that delivered a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts.
Trump told the Post ""I don't see"" climate change as man-made, despite the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community that climate change is caused by human activity.
""One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers,"" Trump told the Post. ""You look at our air and our water, and it's right now at a record clean.""
The government report said the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its gross domestic product -- by the end of the century.
Trump also threatened to cancel his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week after Russian ships opened fire on and seized three Ukrainian vessels near Crimea. The President is expected to meet with the foreign leader at a G20 meeting in Argentina, and is scheduled to discuss security and regional issues, Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Tuesday during the White House briefing.
Trump said he was waiting for the ""full report"" from his national security team, according to the Post, and said the report ""will be very determinative.""
""Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting. ... I don't like that aggression. I don't want that aggression at all,"" Trump told the Post.

Remote Indian Tribe Kills American Missionary Trying To Force Christianity On Them,"They’re the  “sex-crazed tribe” cut off from the world for 30,000 years and they don’t like visitors — especially fanatical  holier-than-thou missionaries anxious to ram Christianity down their throats. They repel all visitors by shooting them with poison arrows. Their message is quite clear: “This is our island, and we don’t want any intruders, so KEEP AWAY!” 

Poison arrows, knives, spears, clubs, axes, rocks — all of them have been waved very angrily. Over the years, the message from the natives of the tiny island of North Sentinel in the Bay of Bengal could not have been clearer. ‘Keep away. Go home. Buzz off. Visitors not welcome. We want to be alone.’

Of course they do.

The Sentinelese are one of a very few remaining ‘uncontacted peoples’ in the world and they are determined to keep it that way. Which means we know tantalisingly little about their language, their culture, their belief system or even how many of them there are.

But what we do know is that they have lived happily and largely healthily on their tiny, lush, mangrove-swamped 20-square-mile island for at least 30,000 years.

During which time, they have feasted on wild pig, clams, berries and honey, engaged in energetic communal sex sessions on the beach and repelled pretty much every visitor (well-meaning or threatening) with a flurry of poison arrows and razor sharp machetes.

So it wasn’t such a surprise last weekend when John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old American Christian missionary-cum-thrill-seeking explorer who visited the island was felled by a poison arrow and then dragged round the white sand beaches by a piece of twine until he was dead.

Apparently Chau, a graduate of the evangelical Oral Roberts University, Oklahoma, who had previously declared visiting North Sentinel as his ‘must-do adventure’, had decided his life’s calling was converting the Sentinelese to Christianity.

Poor well-intentioned Chau! Of course, his death is an utter tragedy — a young life cut off in such an horrific and courageous way. He continued walking into the arrows as they fired, so intent was he on delivering his message from God.

And from all accounts he was a wonderful human being — ‘kind’, ‘big-hearted’ and ‘wonderful fun’.



JOHN CHAU, 26-YEAR-OLD CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY
killed last weekend by the natives of North Sentinel island
for visiting their remote island against their will.

LD: I disagree most emphatically with the politically correct writer of this article, Jane Fryer, that this reckless and stupid  26-year-old Chinese American “missionary” is some kind of heroic martyr whose “death is an utter tragedy — a young life cut off in such an heroic and courageous way.” His death may have been “horrific” but the word “courageous” is surely out of place and suggests we ought to sympathize with this foolish young religious nut trying to force his way into an isolated island community bearing unwanted gifts.

We now know from studying history that any nation imprudent enough to welcome Christian missionaries into their midst, whether in the far East or in the New World or the Antipodes, soon ended up colonized and exploited to the hilt by their benefactors.

It took the Chinese and Indians many centuries  to throw off the shackles of their Christian invaders, who used religion as a cunning tool to gain access to their countries. They then used their gunboats and superior weaponry to batten on the natives like parasites. Evicting the toxic Western squatters was not an easy task, and the loot spirited away in the process remains incalculable to this day.

We agree with the writer of this article, however,  as she continues: “But he [John Chao] shouldn’t have been there [in the first place]. Under Indian law, it is illegal for anyone to be within five nautical miles of the islands and, since last year, even filming the natives in the Andaman Islands — which include North Sentinel — has been illegal.”



LD (continued) : North Sentinel island, which is part of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, is now under Indian jurisdiction. India has decided, correctly in my view, that the people of this remote island community are a rare “protected species”. And that nosey anthropologists, do-gooder missionaries, and other opportunistic intruders should have the decency to keep away when they are clearly not welcome.

As we all know now from the study of imperial history, it’s only one small step from seemingly innocent tape recorders and  cameras and nice Christian missionaries armed with New Testaments — to Coca Cola, McDonalds,  plastic-strewn beaches, high-rise casinos, cocaine snorters, call girls, and, last but not least — the final gift from the dark gods! — sex tourism laid on for plane loads of decadent deviants from the West. 

“No thank you!” says India.

In 1974, Western visitors to the island tried to seduce the natives by offering them silly gifts, which included, bizarrely, a miniature plastic car, a live pig, and a bunch of aluminium cooking pots. 

You can’t make this up. [LD] 

JANE FRYER CONTINUES:

This [India’s “hands off” policy] is partly to protect visitors such as Chau from the natives’ deadly tendencies.

But more importantly, it is to ensure the continued survival of the world’s last pre-neolithic tribe. A people, so isolated, so apart from, so unexposed to modern life that they are unlikely to have any resistance common illnesses such as flu, measles or even a cold.

As Sophie Grig, a senior researcher with Survival International, put it: “This is one of the most vulnerable tribes on the planet. He could be passing on diseases that could literally wipe them all out.”

Which as well as being a disaster for them, would be an anthropological catastrophe. Because the Sentinelese are the only surviving direct descendants of the first humans in Asia. More than 75,000 years ago they made their way from Africa to the Middle East, Burma and India.

Eventually, they reached the Andaman Islands. Some moved on, but others stayed on North Sentinel, drawn by the lush mangrove jungles, perfect white sandy beaches and a natural bounty so rich and easy to plunder there was no need to cultivate the land. The men hunted turtle, pigs and fish with spears, bows and arrows tipped with bone and hardwood.

The women gathered tubers, coconuts berries and clams and caught fish in homemade nets. In the summer they collected honey, smearing their bodies with a special bee-repellent leaf paste. All went naked (but for a few leaves, fibre strings and ornaments) and lived in huts in small family-based groups.

And that’s how they still live 30,000 years on, protected by the sea and their own latent aggression from modernisation, gadgets, plastic, stress and other humans.

The first documented contact with the tribe was made over 1,000 years ago by Chinese and Arabian explorers who were driven back with a barrage of arrows and described the natives as being three feet tall with human bodies and bird beaks. Pretty much every attempt to visit them since has ended in disaster.

When Marco Polo encountered the islands in the 13th century, he wrote: “They are a most violent and cruel generation who seem to eat everybody they catch.” And, in 1563, a sailor, Master Caesar Frederick, warned: “If any ship, by ill fortune, stop at these islands, no one comes back alive.”

So for a long time, even when the rest of the Andaman and nearby Nicobar islands were colonised by the British in 1850 and turned into a penal colony, the Sentinelese were left alone to hunt, eat and generally make merry in their fecund island paradise.

Until 1880, when a British colonial expedition led by Maurice Vidal Portman landed with a squad of armed police, kidnapped an entire family and whisked them off to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands. The adults died immediately and a red-faced Portman hastily returned the four children with gifts.

LD: Maurice Vidal Portman is probably Jewish, as his name would suggest. Most of the key officials in the Rothschild-backed East India Company were known to be Jewish. These included the British sephardic Jew, Elias David Sassoon, and his equally predatory colleague Silas Aaron Hardoon, his partner in the firm E.D. Sassoon & Co. The same Jewish merchants were also to be found in China, financing the Opium Wars and turning millions of the Chinese people into helpless opium addicts.

See my article “China and the Jews“. Scroll down to Part 2: “Opium, Sex and Death”. See also here and here (with 271 comments). [LD] 

For nearly a century after that, the islanders were left largely to their own devices.

Until, in 1970, a group of anthropologists approached the island, notebooks and cameras at the ready, and were peppered with arrows and then treated to an energetic beach sex show, described by one observer as a ‘sort of community mating, a frenzied dance of desire’.

Four years later, there was another invasion attempt — this time the visitors were laden with offerings of a miniature plastic car, a live pig and a selection of aluminium pots.

The response? Yet another volley of poison arrows.

Occasionally, instead of firing weapons, the men wave their penises very angrily and, on rare occasions, would accept the odd coconut before opening fire. But the message has never changed.

“Please leave us alone. We don’t want to be friends.”

Their decision to resist contact with the outside world is an intelligent one. They are frequently referred to as Stone Age or primitive, but from the little the outside world has been allowed to learn, we know they are anything but.

Today there are just 100 groups of people scattered across the world — including the Yanomami in northern Brazil; the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode in Bolivia; and, until the last member died in 2011, the Andaman Islands’ Bo tribe — who know nothing of our world and do their utmost to keep theirs a mystery.

But however unwelcoming they are, visitors keep coming.

Chau sounds like a bright and lovely young man. He claimed to have been ‘fascinated’ by the people of North Sentinel and had researched them. Of course he knew of the danger he faced, if not the danger from his germs to the islanders.

LD : The fact that Chau knew his germs could kill them, but still decided to convert them to Christianity before decimating them with disease, tells us everything we need to know about this narcissistic young do-gooder.  A “bright and lovely young man”?  Oh dear, the author of this article appears to possess the same moral values of the village idiot she praises! —  How truly depressing.     

Chau wrote a letter to his parents before he left, saying: “I think it’s worth it to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed.” He’d visited several times before the fateful trip last week — taking scissors, safety pins and a football as gifts. [!!!]

In return they rained arrows down on him and damaged his canoe.

“I have been so nice to them, why are they so angry and aggressive?” he asked in his diary.

The Indian government adopts what it calls a “hands off, eyes on” policy for the tribe, which means officials moor boats nearby, to check on welfare from a safe distance. While the seven fishermen who transported Chau and his canoe to within the exclusion zone — and watched while he was killed — have all been arrested, there is no question anyone on the island will be bothered by the authorities.

Let’s hope other reckless souls learn from Chau’s death. The survival of the islanders depends on it.",,,https://www.darkmoon.me/2018/remote-indian-tribe-kills-american-missionary-trying-to-force-christianity-on-them/,0,1543104000000,1,1,12,1948,0,0,0,-0.05,0.05425400213154021,0.0,0.034751334043846734
Manafort’s Lawyer Said to Brief Trump Attorneys on What He Told Mueller,"WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Paul Manafort, the president’s onetime campaign chairman, repeatedly briefed President Trump’s lawyers on his client’s discussions with federal investigators after Mr. Manafort agreed to cooperate with the special counsel, according to one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers and two other people familiar with the conversations.

The arrangement was highly unusual and inflamed tensions with the special counsel’s office when prosecutors discovered it after Mr. Manafort began cooperating two months ago, the people said. Some legal experts speculated that it was a bid by Mr. Manafort for a presidential pardon even as he worked with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in hopes of a lighter sentence.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s personal lawyers, acknowledged the arrangement on Tuesday and defended it as a source of valuable insights into the special counsel’s inquiry and where it was headed. Such information could help shape a legal defense strategy, and it also appeared to give Mr. Trump and his legal advisers ammunition in their public relations campaign against Mr. Mueller’s office.

For example, Mr. Giuliani said, Mr. Manafort’s lawyer Kevin M. Downing told him that prosecutors hammered away at whether the president knew about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting where Russians promised to deliver damaging information on Hillary Clinton to his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The president has long denied knowing about the meeting in advance. “He wants Manafort to incriminate Trump,” Mr. Giuliani declared of Mr. Mueller.

[Paul Manafort’s life has followed a trajectory of greed, deception and ego.]

While Mr. Downing’s discussions with the president’s team violated no laws, they helped contribute to a deteriorating relationship between lawyers for Mr. Manafort and Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors, who accused Mr. Manafort of holding out on them despite his pledge to assist them in any matter they deemed relevant, according to the people. That conflict spilled into public view on Monday when the prosecutors took the rare step of declaring that Mr. Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying to them about a variety of subjects.

Mr. Manafort’s lawyers insisted that their client had been truthful but acknowledged that the two sides were at an impasse. Mr. Manafort will now face sentencing on two conspiracy charges and eight counts of financial fraud — crimes that could put him behind bars for at least 10 years.

Mr. Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Though it was unclear how frequently he spoke to Mr. Trump’s lawyers or how much he revealed, his updates helped reassure Mr. Trump’s legal team that Mr. Manafort had not implicated the president in any possible wrongdoing.

Mr. Giuliani, who has taken an aggressive posture against the Russia investigation since Mr. Trump hired him in April, seized on Mr. Downing’s information to unleash lines of attack onto the special counsel.

In asserting that investigators were unnecessarily targeting Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani accused the prosecutor overseeing the Manafort investigation, Andrew Weissmann, of keeping Mr. Manafort in solitary confinement simply in the hopes of forcing him to give false testimony about the president.

But detention officials decide whether inmates serve in solitary confinement, according to law enforcement officials, and allies of Mr. Manafort have said he is there for his own safety.

A spokesman for Mr. Mueller’s office declined to comment. Mr. Weissmann is a longtime senior Justice Department prosecutor who specializes in prosecuting financial crimes and turning defendants into cooperating witnesses. His aggressive nature has earned him two competing reputations: Prosecutors view him as a relentless investigator who has overseen some of the Justice Department’s most complex investigations, but some defense lawyers say he is overly combative and will bend the facts to gain a conviction.

In his own recent Twitter attacks on the special counsel, the president seemed to imply that he had inside information about the prosecutors’ lines of inquiry and frustrations. “Wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie,” Mr. Trump wrote on Tuesday.

Earlier this month, he tweeted: “The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want.”

Mr. Manafort’s legal team had long kept Mr. Trump’s lawyers abreast of developments in his case under a joint defense agreement. The president’s team has pursued such pacts as a way to monitor the special counsel’s inquiry. Mr. Giuliani said last month that the president’s lawyers had agreements with lawyers for 32 witnesses or subjects of Mr. Mueller’s 18-month-old investigation.

Defense lawyers involved in investigations with multiple witnesses often form such alliances so they can share information without running afoul of attorney-client privilege rules. But when one defendant decides to cooperate with the government in a plea deal, that defense lawyer typically pulls out rather than antagonize the prosecutors who can influence the client’s sentence. For instance, a lawyer for the president’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn withdrew last year from such an agreement with Mr. Trump’s lawyers before Mr. Flynn pleaded  guilty to a felony offense and agreeing to help the special counsel.

Mr. Manafort’s lawyers, on the other hand, maintained their joint defense agreement with the president’s legal team even after Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty to two conspiracy counts in September and began answering questions in at least a dozen sessions with the special counsel.


How the Mueller Investigation Could Play Out for Trump
If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.

May 23, 2018
Even if the pact was mostly informal at that point, law enforcement experts said it was still highly unusual for Mr. Manafort’s lawyers to keep up such contacts once their client had pledged to help the prosecutors in hope of a lighter punishment for his crimes.

Mr. Manafort must have wanted to keep a line open to the president in hope of a pardon, said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney who now teaches law at University of Michigan. “I’m not able to think of another reason,” she said.

If Mr. Manafort wanted to stay on the prosecutors’ good side, “it would make no sense for him to continue to share information with other subjects of the investigation,” said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney and senior F.B.I. official. He added: “He is either all in or all out with respect to cooperation. Typically, there is no middle ground.”

In another development on Tuesday, Mr. Manafort categorically denied a report in The Guardian claiming that he met with Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, around the time he joined the Trump campaign in the spring of 2016. Mr. Mueller’s team has been investigating whether any associates of Mr. Trump conspired with Moscow’s operation to influence the presidential election with documents stolen from Democratic computers and distributed by WikiLeaks.

“This story is totally false and deliberately libelous. I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him. I have never been contacted by anyone connected to WikiLeaks, either directly or indirectly. I have never reached out to Assange or WikiLeaks on any matter,” Mr. Manafort said in a statement released by his spokesman. He said he was considering legal action against the newspaper. WikiLeaks said on Twitter that Mr. Assange planned to sue the newspaper for libel over the article, which The New York Times did not independently confirm.

Listen to ‘The Daily’: What’s Going On With Paul Manafort?
We look at several twists in the case of President Trump’s former campaign chairman that raise fresh questions for the special counsel investigation.
Last year, a lawyer for Mr. Trump broached the idea of presidential pardons to lawyers for both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn as prosecutors were building cases against both men, according to people familiar with the conversations. The lawyer, John Dowd, who later resigned from the president’s team, denied ever raising the prospect of a pardon.

But later, Mr. Giuliani suggested that Mr. Manafort and others might be eligible for pardons after Mr. Mueller’s inquiry ends, and the prospect has continued to hover over Mr. Manafort’s case. On Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said she had no knowledge of any conversations about a pardon for Mr. Manafort. A week ago, after months of negotiations, Mr. Trump provided written answers to some questions from Mr. Mueller.

Some defense lawyers have suggested that prosecutors deliberately fashioned Mr. Manafort’s plea agreement to counter a possible pardon. In forcing Mr. Manafort to forfeit almost all of his wealth — including five homes, various bank accounts and an insurance policy — prosecutors specified that they could seize his assets under civil procedures “without regard to the status of his criminal conviction.”

Harry Litman, a University of California, San Diego, law professor and a former deputy assistant attorney general, said that he had seen similar provisions in other cases. But other legal experts said it seemed tailor-made to ensure Mr. Manafort would lose much of his wealth, no mat",,"Michael S.

Logan Paul Apologizes For Controversial Unboxing Video,"Los Angeles – The popular youtuber Logan Paul is in hot waters again, and had to issue another apology after a controversial unboxing video, The Hard Times reports.

Apparently, he opened up a casket in a local cemetery, in a video titled “UNBOXING IN GRAVEYARD (SAVAGE)”.

The video was removed by Youtube’s team around 2 hours after being uploaded, since it literally showed the Youtuber in Westwood Village Memorial Park in California, digging up a casket and opening it with his friends.

“Woah check out this killer swag,” said Paul, “So, we got a dude inside who looks like he hasn’t hit the gym in years. What’s up, bro? What’s with those skinny arms, bro?”

Paul removed the body from the casket, lifted it and shouted “Get it? DEAD-Lifting!”, while playing Despacito.

Two hours later, he issued an apology on Twitter:

“Let’s start with this. I’m sorry. Again. I never meant to offend anybody when I posted a video where I unbox a coffin, check out the cool collectibles inside, take out the corpse, and deadlift it. LOL! Sorry, just remembering that joke. Fuckin’ classic. Anyway, all I wanted to do was raise awareness about death, which is a very serious issue because if you are dead you can’t like and subscribe. #logang #maverick”",,,https://www.huzlers.com/logan-paul-apologizes-for-controversial-unboxing-video/,0,0,1,1,7,214,0,0,0,0.55,0.0744047619047619,0.0,0.20813492063492064
Donald Trump Promises To Stop “The Crazy Muslims From North Korea”,"Washington, D.C. – Within hours of North Korea’s nuclear test Friday, it had become a political weapon in the U.S. The test – Pyongyang’s fifth and most powerful – had enough force to “rip the heart out of a city,” one expert said. It marks one more step in North Korea’s efforts to develop the missiles and miniaturized warheads needed to reach its perceived enemies. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seized on the test to discredit his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, arguing that “it’s just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state.”

“The whole time that woman was secretary of state, she didn’t do one good thing on the job, not a single one,” Trump told CNN after a rally in Pensacola, Florida. “And it ended with the catastrophic Benghazi scandal in 2012, where we lost an ambassador and several embassy personnel. And as if that wasn’t enough, I read somewhere the other day that she doesn’t feel that we lost anyone important in that bombing. Now, this is the Democratic presidential candidate we’re talking about here, I want you to understand that.”


Asked how he would tackle the problem, the billionaire businessman promised he would “stop those crazy Muslims from North Korea at all cost.” “Let tell you, I’ve been in difficult situations all my life. I’ve struggled, I’ve been broke, I’ve been booed thousands of times. I’ve had my share of seemingly impossible situations and you want to know something? I’m still standing and I’m right here, and that’s the kind of man America needs to help it become great again,” he argued.

“Those crazy North Korean Muslims think they can get away with threatening the world; well, they’ve got another thing coming, I’ll tell you that,” he continued. “You know how I got a reputation as a wall-builder because of my presidential campaign and plans to build a wall on the Mexico border? Well, it wasn’t just for show. I am going to build a wall so great around all of North Korea that Kim Jong Un is going to have to push his engineers into creating an artificial sun just so he’ll be able to take a leak. And I’m not going to stop at a giant wall; for North Korea, I’m going all out with a ceiling, as well. I’m going to turn that country into one giant tomb, so that if he ever decides to launch those missiles, the only thing he’ll be hitting is his own fat a*s.”

“This is just another proof that you just can’t reason with Muslims, they’re not a reasonable people or religion. And the sanctions aren’t going to work, either. They’ll just start eating less than they already are and they’re going to get leaner and more difficult to kill if there’s ever a war with them. No, those North Korean Muslims are a special breed. The only thing that would work against them is stripping them of their motivation to go on fighting. Going after their will to live is what we’ll have to do if we want to beat them, and my wall with a hatch is going to deliver just that, unlike Hillary Clinton, who would only bend over for them, because, you know, that’s about all women like her are ever good at,” he concluded.",,Alex Stevan,https://politicot.com/donald-trump-promises-stop-crazy-muslims-north-korea/,0,1504396800000,1,1,11,554,0,0,0,-0.6,0.09589577089577091,0.0,0.23196525696525697

Trump appears consumed by Mueller investigation as details emerge,"Washington (CNN)Donald Trump's behavior isn't doing much to bolster White House assurances that he's got nothing to worry about from Robert Mueller's probe, after a series of potentially ominous turns in the Russia investigation.

The President's recent barrage of tweets and comments and testimony from sources close to him -- coinciding with thickening intrigue around the special counsel -- hint instead at deep concern on Trump's part.
""While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief. This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday, a day after blasting the special counsel as a ""conflicted prosecutor gone rogue.""
Despite this outburst of fury, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders painted a portrait of a President who was serenely awaiting Mueller's findings.
""I don't think the President has any concerns about the report because he knows that there was no wrongdoing by him and that there was no collusion,"" Sanders told reporters at her first daily briefing in a month.
The explanation for Trump's angst over his predicament seems to lie in a flurry of startling and potentially significant developments and reports swirling around his jailed ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and other associates.
Giuliani: Trump &#39;upset for weeks&#39; over Mueller squeezing Manafort

Giuliani: Trump 'upset for weeks' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16
Trump, the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss, is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril.
He has no choice but to watch as Mueller, an adversary whose discrete public profile makes him an elusive target, grinds away, apparently getting ever closer to Trump's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself.
""The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on,"" Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless, unseen foe.
Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN's Dana Bash the President had been ""upset for weeks"" about ""the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.""
Details emerge
Manafort denies ever meeting with Assange
Manafort denies ever meeting with Assange
While the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016, a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity.
In the space of a few days, it emerged that Manafort's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions.
The Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton, on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it ""totally false and deliberately libelous"" and Wikileaks was ""willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor's head that Manafort never met Assange.""
The paper's sourcing was also vague, making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting. So for now, joining the dots cannot produce definitive conclusions.
CNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative, Jerome Corsi, as a go between.
In another development, CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting, according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter.
Such is the secrecy around Mueller's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows. The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice.
If there is such supporting evidence, it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump. But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election.
In his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort, for instance, Mueller's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge.
There was immediate speculation that Manafort's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President. The White House said there had been talk of such a step. But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon, Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact. This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller's progress, another factor that might explain his recent anger.
The New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort's lawyers.
Potential impact

Stone's efforts to seek WikiLeaks documents detailed in draft Mueller document
Former Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary.
""What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking?"" Ben-Veniste said.
It was not clear whether Manafort's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange. But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy, he or his hosts are likely under surveillance, intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access.
Mueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions. Democrats, poised to take power in the House, are already gearing up to reinvigorate a congressional investigation on Russia.
What Democrats in Congress will do if they&#39;re in power after midterms
What Democrats in Congress will do if they're in power after midterms
""A meeting with Julian Assange would be the smoking gun,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee.
The House Democratic majority could eventually pose a grave threat to Trump's presidency and represents a devastating erosion of the force field of political protection so far offered by the GOP majority on Washington power -- another possible reason for his mood.
In the long term, any sustained dip in Trump's popularity -- his disapproval rating climbed to 60% in Gallup's weekly tracking poll -- could even eventually raise questions about the solidity of his standing among Senate Republicans that has so far always been seen as impenetrable.
Expectations high
The latest drama around Manafort is even more tantalizing given the possibility that the collapse of the cooperation agreement could prompt Mueller to reveal more about his tightly private investigation.
Special counsel prosecutors plan to detail Manafort's alleged lies in a number of areas in a sentencing memo that could be filed with the court in the coming weeks.
Mueller has used indictments and court filings throughout his tenure to embroider a rich picture of Russian intelligence hacking, a social media campaign to disrupt the election and cozy ties between Manafort and pro-Russian political figures in Ukraine.
So expectations will be high ahead of his filing if it is done in public
""Without releasing a report, without another indictment, Mr. Mueller would be in a position to reveal a lot of information that we would all find very interesting about his investigation in open court,"" said Ben-Veniste.
Such a filing is also now seen in Washington as a potential way around any attempt to disrupt a final report of the Russia investigation by Trump's acting-Attorney General Matt Whitaker.
The new focus on the man picked to succeed the sacked Jeff Sessions may also point to another possible spur for the President's current fury.
Trump has often seemed to know more about the probe than is available, and it's possible that Whitaker, who is now in charge of overseeing Mueller, has read him in on the inside story of the investigation.
